### Numerical Solutions of the Schrödinger Equation (CO)

As discussed previously, the Schrödinger equation typically cannot be solved analytically in complex systems. Therefore, in order to perform electron scattering simulations, we must calculate numerical solutions of [](#eq:Shrodinger_time) for electron waves. First, we define the {cite:t}`debroglie1925recherches` wavelength of a free electrons (corrected for relativistic effects) as

```{math}
:label: eq:wavelength

\lambda = \frac{h \, c}{\sqrt{e \, E_0 (2 \, m \, c^2 + e \, E_0)}},
```

where {math}`h` is the Plank constant, {math}`c` is the speed of light, {math}`e` is the electron charge, and {math}`E_0` is the accelerating voltage applied to the electron. Using SI units for [](#eq:wavelength) will give the wavelength in units of meters. In practice we typically use length units of  for all calculations, and therefore multiple this result by {math}`10^{10}`.

Next, we define the electron-potential interaction constant as (the numerical values of these constants can be found in  [](#app:constants))

```{math}
:label: eq:interaction_constant

\sigma = \frac{2 \pi \, m \, e \, \lambda}{h^2}.
```

In our simulations, we will assume the {math}`z`-position coordinate of the wavefunction {math}`\psi(\bm{r})` is alone sufficient to describe its propagation in both time and space, and therefore drop the {math}`t` coordinate. Substituting [](#eq:wavelength) and [](#eq:interaction_constant) into [](#eq:Shrodinger_time), we obtain {cite:p}`kirkland2020`

```{math}
:label: eq:Shrodinger_electron

\frac{\partial }{\partial z} \psi(\bm{r})
    =
    \frac{\ii \lambda}{4 \pi} {\nabla_{xy}}^2 \psi(\bm{r})
    + 
    \ii \sigma V(\bm{r}) \psi(\bm{r}),
```

where {math}`{\nabla_{xy}}^2 = \partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2`. This equation shows the overall numerical recipe we will use; when the wavefunction {math}`\psi_0(\bm{r})` is at position {math}`z_0`, we will evaluate the operators on the right hand side over a distance {math}`\Delta z` to calculate the new wavefunction {math}`\psi(\bm{r})` at position {math}`z_0 + \Delta z`. {cite:t}`kirkland2020` gives the formal operator solution to [](#eq:Shrodinger_electron) as

```{math}
:label: eq:Shrodinger_solution

\psi(\bm{r})
    = 
    \exp \left\{
    \int_{z_0}^{z_0 + \Delta z} 
    \left[
        \frac{\ii \lambda}{4 \pi} {\nabla_{xy}}^2
        + 
        \ii \sigma V(\bm{r})
    \right] dz
    \right\}
    \psi_0(\bm{r})
```

Assuming {math}`\Delta z` is small, [](#eq:Shrodinger_solution) can be simplified to

```{math}
:label: eq:Shrodinger_simple

\psi(\bm{r})
    = 
    \exp\left[
        \frac{\ii \lambda}{4 \pi} \Delta z {\nabla_{xy}}^2
        + 
        \ii \sigma V_{\Delta z}(\bm{r})
    \right]
    \psi_0(\bm{r})
```

where

```{math}
V_{\Delta z}(\bm{r})
    =
    \int_{z_0}^{z_0 + \Delta z} 
    V(\bm{r}) dz,
```

is a thin slice of the potential. Unfortunately, even with the above approximations, [](#eq:Shrodinger_simple) cannot be solved in closed form due to the two non-commuting operators. Instead, we will solve it numerically by using a split-step method, where we calculate solutions for each operator independently, and alternating their application to the electron wavefunction. This solution was introduced by {cite:t}`cowley1957scattering` and is known as the multislice method.
