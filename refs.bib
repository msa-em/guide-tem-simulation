  abstract = {Although scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of individual heavy atoms were reported 50 years ago, the applications of atomic-resolution STEM imaging became wide spread only after the practical realization of aberration correctors on field-emission STEM/ TEM instruments to form sub-Ångstrom electron probes. The innovative designs and advances of electron optical systems, the fundamental understanding of electron–specimen interaction processes, and the advances in detector technology all played a major role in achieving the goal of atomic-resolution STEM imaging of practical materials. It is clear that tremendous advances in computer technology and electronics, image acquisition and processing algorithms, image simulations, and precision machining synergistically made atomic-resolution STEM imaging routinely accessible. It is anticipated that further hardware/software development is needed to achieve three-dimensional atomicresolution STEM imaging with single-atom chemical sensitivity, even for electron-beam-sensitive materials. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big-data science are expected to significantly enhance the impact of STEM and associated techniques on many research fields such as materials science and engineering, quantum and nanoscale science, physics and chemistry, and biology and medicine. This review focuses on advances of STEM imaging from the invention of the field-emission electron gun to the realization of aberration-corrected and monochromated atomic-resolution STEM and its broad applications.},

  abstract = {Nuclear spins are highly coherent quantum objects. In large ensembles, their control and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, for example, in chemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear spins also featured in early proposals for solid-state quantum computers1 and demonstrations of quantum search2 and factoring3 algorithms. Scaling up such concepts requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when coupled to an electron4–6. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating magnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices, because the field cannot be localized or screened. Control via electric fields would resolve this problem, but previous methods7–9 relied on transducing electric signals into magnetic fields via the electron–nuclear hyperfine interaction, which severely affects nuclear coherence. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum control of a single 123Sb (spin-7/2) nucleus using localized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic device. The method exploits an idea proposed in 196110 but not previously realized experimentally with a single nucleus. Our results are quantitatively supported by a microscopic theoretical model that reveals how the purely electrical modulation of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction results in coherent nuclear spin transitions that are uniquely addressable owing to lattice strain. The spin dephasing time, 0.1 seconds, is orders of magnitude longer than those obtained by methods that require a coupled electron spin to achieve electrical driving. These results show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could be deployed as chaotic models, strain sensors and hybrid spin-mechanical quantum systems using all-electrical controls. Integrating electrically controllable nuclei with quantum dots11,12 could pave the way to scalable, nuclear- and electron-spin-based quantum computers in silicon that operate without the need for oscillating magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanomaterials’ reactivity towards oxygen is very poor, limiting their potential applications. However, nitrogen doping is an established way to introduce active sites that facilitate interaction with gases. This boosts the materials’ reactivity for bio-/gas sensing and enhances their catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. Despite this interest, the role of differently bonded nitrogen dopants in the interaction with oxygen is obscured by experimental challenges and has so far resisted clear conclusions. We study the interaction of molecular oxygen with graphene doped via nitrogen plasma by in situ high-resolution synchrotron techniques, supported by density functional theory core level simulations. The interaction leads to oxygen dissociation and the formation of carbon-oxygen single bonds on graphene, along with a band gap opening and a rounding of the Dirac cone. The change of the N 1 s core level signal indicates that graphitic nitrogen is involved in the observed mechanism: the adsorbed oxygen molecule is dissociated and the two O atoms chemisorb with epoxy bonds to the nearest carbon neighbours of the graphitic nitrogen. Our findings help resolve existing controversies and offer compelling new evidence of the ORR pathway.},

  title = {{abTEM}: transmission electron microscopy from first principles},
  volume = {1},
  shorttitle = {{abTEM}},
  doi = {10.12688/openreseurope.13015.1},
  abstract = {Simulation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images or diffraction patterns is often required to interpret experimental data. Since nuclear cores dominate electron scattering, the scattering potential is typically described using an independent atom model, which completely neglects valence bonding and its effect on the transmitting electrons. As instrumentation has advanced, new measurements have revealed subtle details of the scattering potential that were previously not accessible to experiment.

We have created an open-source simulation code designed to meet these demands by integrating the ability to calculate the potential via density functional theory (DFT) with a flexible modular software design. abTEM can simulate most standard imaging modes and incorporates the latest algorithmic developments. The development of new techniques requires a program that is accessible to domain experts without extensive programming experience. abTEM is written purely in Python and designed for easy modification and extension.

The effective use of modern open-source libraries makes our performance highly competitive with existing optimized codes on both CPUs and GPUs. abTEM is designed to work in an interactive Python notebook, allowing us to leverage an extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as the Atomic Simulation Environment and the DFT code GPAW. This creates a seamless and reproducible workflow from defining an atomic structure, calculating molecular dynamics (MD) and electrostatic potentials, to the analysis of results, all in a single, easy-to-read document.

This article provides ongoing documentation of abTEM development. In this first version, we show use cases for hexagonal boron nitride, where valence bonding can be detected, a 4D-STEM simulation of molybdenum disulfide including ptychographic phase reconstruction, a comparison of MD and frozen phonon modeling for convergent-beam electron diffraction of a 2.6-million-atom silicon system, and a performance comparison of our fast PRISM algorithm for a decahedral 20000-atom gold nanoparticle.},

We show that in many cases PRISM can provide a speedup that scales with f4 compared to multislice simulations, with a negligible loss of accuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with large-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy image simulations of a crystalline nanoparticle on an amorphous carbon substrate.},

  abstract = {The reduced dimensionality in two-dimensional materials leads a wealth of unusual properties, which are currently explored for both fundamental and applied sciences. In order to study the crystal structure, edge states, the formation of defects and grain boundaries, or the impact of adsorbates, high resolution microscopy techniques are indispensible. Here we report on the development of an electron holography (EH) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique, which facilitates high spatial resolution by an automatic correction of geometric aberrations. Distinguished features of EH beyond conventional TEM imaging are the gap-free spatial information signal transfer and higher dose efficiency for certain spatial frequency bands as well as direct access to the projected electrostatic potential of the 2D material. We demonstrate these features at the example of h-BN, at which we measure the electrostatic potential as a function of layer number down to the monolayer limit and obtain evidence for a systematic increase of the potential at the zig-zag edges.},

  abstract = {Single atom impurities in graphene, substitutional silicon defects in particular, have been observed to diffuse under electron beam irradiation. However, the relative importance of elastic and inelastic scattering in facilitating their mobility remains unclear. Here, we employ excited-state electronic structure calculations to explore potential inelastic effects, and find an electronically nonadiabatic excited-state silicon diffusion pathway involving “softened” Si–C bonding that presents an ∼2 eV lower diffusion barrier than the ground-state pathway. Beam-induced transition rates to this state indicate that the excited-state pathway is accessible through irradiation of the defect site. However, even in the limit of fully elastic scattering, upward nonadiabatic transitions are also possible along the diffusion coordinate, increasing the diffusion barrier and further demonstrating the potential for electronic nonadiabaticity to influence beam-induced atomic transformations in materials. We also propose some experimentally testable signatures of such excited-state pathways.},

  abstract = {It has been known since the 1970s that the movement of the center of mass (COM) of a convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern is linearly related to the (projected) electrical field in the sample. We re-derive a contrast transfer function (CTF) for a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging technique based on this movement from the point of view of image formation and continue by performing a two-dimensional integration on the two images based on the two components of the COM movement. The resulting integrated COM (iCOM) STEM technique yields a scalar image that is linear in the phase shift caused by the sample and therefore also in the local (projected) electrostatic potential field of a thin sample. We confirm that the differential phase contrast (DPC) STEM technique using a segmented detector with 4 quadrants (4Q) yields a good approximation for the COM movement. Performing a two-dimensional integration, just as for the COM, we obtain an integrated DPC (iDPC) image which is approximately linear in the phase of the sample. Beside deriving the CTFs of iCOM and iDPC, we clearly point out the objects of the two corresponding imaging techniques, and highlight the differences to objects corresponding to COM-, DPC-, and (HA) ADF-STEM. The theory is validated with simulations and we present first experimental results of the iDPC-STEM technique showing its capability for imaging both light and heavy elements with atomic resolution and a good signal to noise ratio (SNR).},

  abstract = {Aberration-corrected optics have made electron microscopy at atomic resolution a widespread and often essential tool for characterizing nanoscale structures. Image resolution has traditionally been improved by increasing the numerical aperture of the lens (α) and the beam energy, with the state-of-the-art at 300 kiloelectronvolts just entering the deep sub-ångström (that is, less than 0.5 ångström) regime. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are imaged at lower beam energies to avoid displacement damage from large momenta transfers, limiting spatial resolution to about 1 ångström. Here, by combining an electron microscope pixel-array detector with the dynamic range necessary to record the complete distribution of transmitted electrons and full-field ptychography to recover phase information from the full phase space, we increase the spatial resolution well beyond the traditional numerical-aperture-limited resolution. At a beam energy of 80 kiloelectronvolts, our ptychographic reconstruction improves the image contrast of single-atom defects in MoS2 substantially, reaching an information limit close to 5α, which corresponds to an Abbe diffraction-limited resolution of 0.39 ångström, at the electron dose and imaging conditions for which conventional imaging methods reach only 0.98 ångström.},

In this work, we introduce an accelerated multislice algorithm, named STEMcl, that is capable of simulating series of large super cells typical for defective and amorphous systems, in addition to parameter series using the massive parallelization accessible in today’s commercial PC-hardware, e.g. graphics processing units (GPUs). A new numerical approach is used to overcome the memory constraint limiting the maximum computable system size. This approach creates the possibility to study systematically the contrast formation arising by structural differences. STEM simulations of structure series of a crystalline Si and an amorphous CuZr system are presented and the contrast formation of vacancies/voids are studied. The detectability of vacancies/voids in STEM experiments is discussed in terms of density changes.},

The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, so that the original metallic state, the lattice spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be restored by annealing.

DFT band gap values obtained with the HSE06 functional were notably larger than those from PBE calculations but were significantly lower than band gaps from all GW calculations. On the other hand, all GW-type calculations gave similar band gaps despite some differences in band structures. The band gap (4.9 eV at the highest GW-HSE06 level) was predicted to be smaller than that of fluorographene (8.3 eV) or graphane (6.2 eV). However, chlorographene can be considered a wide-band gap insulator analogous to fluorographene and graphane. Using the Bethe–Salpeter equation, optical absorptions of graphene derivatives were found to be at significantly lower energies due to large binding energies of excitons (1.3, 1.9, and 1.5 eV for chlorographene, fluorographene, and graphane, respectively). Point defects lowered band gaps and absorption energies. Taking into account the low concentration of defects in this type of material, their effect on the discussed electronic properties was rather small.},

Here, recent developments in fast electron detectors and data processing capability is shown to enable electron ptychography, to extend the capability of the STEM by allowing quantitative phase images to be formed simultaneously with incoherent signals. We demonstrate this capability as a practical tool for imaging complex structures containing light and heavy elements, and use it to solve the structure of a beam-sensitive carbon nanostructure.

The compensation of defocus aberrations is also used for the measurement of three-dimensional sample information through post-acquisition optical sectioning.},

Comparison of energy filtered, convergent beam electron diffraction patterns in [110]-Si show good agreement between simulation and experiment. Simulations also show that plasmon excitation decreases the high angle annular dark field signal from atom columns, due to the plasmon scattering angle suppressing electron beam channeling along the atom columns.

In microscopy, and, in particular, in transmission electron microscopy, most of these strategies focus on the retrieval of high-resolution information with the importance of lower resolution data often overlooked. Ptychography offers a means to investigate such data. Ptychography is a robust diffractive imaging technique with fast convergence for phase retrieval but, until now, has not been applied at the nanoscale. In this paper, we use the ptychographical iterative engine to retrieve the phase change at the exit plane of metallic nanoparticles using a conventional transmission electron microscope. Ptychographical reconstructions yielded images with a phase resolution of π/10 and a spatial resolution of 1 nm. These results stand as a first step toward aberration-free lensless imaging. The technique lends itself to be an alternative to off-axis electron holography or focal series reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Seeing single silicon atom vibrations
Vibrational spectroscopy can achieve high energy resolution, but spatial resolution of unperturbed vibrations is more difficult to realize. Hage et al. show that a single-atom impurity in a solid (a silicon atom in graphene) can give rise to distinctive localized vibrational signatures. They used high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to detect this signal. An experimental geometry was chosen that reduced the relative elastic scattering contribution, and repeated scanning near the silicon impurity enhanced the signal. The experimental vibration frequencies are in agreement with ab initio calculations.
Science, this issue p. 1124
Single-atom impurities and other atomic-scale defects can notably alter the local vibrational responses of solids and, ultimately, their macroscopic properties. Using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope, we show that a single substitutional silicon impurity in graphene induces a characteristic, localized modification of the vibrational response. Extensive ab initio calculations reveal that the measured spectroscopic signature arises from defect-induced pseudo-localized phonon modes—that is, resonant states resulting from the hybridization of the defect modes and the bulk continuum—with energies that can be directly matched to the experiments. This finding realizes the promise of vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope with single-atom sensitivity and has broad implications across the fields of physics, chemistry, and materials science.

The phonon-loss process is modeled by a combination of molecular dynamics and elastic multislice calculations within a modified frozen phonon approximation. The key idea is thereby to use a so-called δ thermostat in the classical molecular dynamics simulation to generate frequency dependent configurations of the vibrating specimen’s atomic structure. The method includes correlated motion of atoms and provides vibrational spectrum images at a cost comparable to standard frozen phonon calculations. We demonstrate good agreement of our method with simulations and experiments for a 15 nm flake of hexagonal boron nitride.},

  abstract = {Propagating atomic vibrational waves—phonons—determine important thermal, mechanical, optoelectronic and transport characteristics of materials. Thus a knowledge of phonon dispersion (that is, the dependence of vibrational energy on momentum) is a key part of our understanding and optimization of a material’s behaviour. However, the phonon dispersion of a free-standing monolayer of a two-dimensional material such as graphene, and its local variations, have remained elusive for the past decade because of the experimental limitations of vibrational spectroscopy. Even though electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in transmission has recently been shown to probe local vibrational charge responses1–4, such studies are still limited by momentum space integration due to the focused beam geometry; they are also restricted to polar materials such as boron nitride or oxides1–4, in which huge signals induced by strong dipole moments are present. On the other hand, measurements on graphene performed by inelastic X-ray (neutron) scattering spectroscopy5–7 or EELS in reflection8,9 do not have any spatial resolution and require large microcrystals. Here we provide a new pathway to determine phonon dispersions down to the scale of an individual free-standing graphene monolayer by mapping the distinct vibrational modes for a large momentum transfer. The measured scattering intensities are accurately reproduced and interpreted with density functional perturbation theory10. Additionally, a nanometre-scale mapping of selected momentum-resolved vibrational modes using graphene nanoribbon structures has enabled us to spatially disentangle bulk, edge and surface vibrations. Our results are a proof-of-principle demonstration of the feasibility of studying local vibrational modes in two-dimensional monolayer materials at the nanometre scale.},

Chemical entities, in the sense of the Lewis theory, can be idengified and classified according to the role they play in these processes. Covalent (SiO2), ionic (BeO), molecular (CO2, O2), and metallic (Na, K) systems have been selected to illustrate the ability of ELF to gain insight into the global understanding of the transformations. Detailed topological analysis of the bonding reconstruction process clearly distinguishes transitions where the bonding nature of the solid is not altered, and just a reorganization takes place, to those where the chemical pattern suffers a dramatic change. We have highlighted the close relationship between energy, structure and bonding across several transition pathways and how ELF can be of help to anticipate pressure induced emerging structures and to discard among competitive transition mechanism},

Both cations are usually coordinated in a linear fashion to two oxygens, particularly for Cu(I). In many compounds, the Cu(I) and Ag(I) cations also adopt close-packed (and related) configurations with short metal–metal distances that are strongly suggestive of the occurrence of metal–metal bonding1,2 despite their formal nd10 configuration. Such observations have been explained3,4 by invoking the participation in bonding of electronic orbitals of higher principal quantum number—that is, (n + 1)s and (n + 1)p—accompanied by the creation of d-orbital holes on the metal ion. To test this hypothesis, we have used a recently developed method of quantitative convergent-beam electron diffraction5 combined with X-ray diffraction to map the charge-density distribution in the simple oxide Cu2O, the results of which we then compare with electronic-structure calculations. We are able to image directly the d holes on the copper atoms, and also demonstrate the existence of Cu–Cu bonding in this compound.},

  abstract = {Combining constrained density function theory (cDFT) with Marcus theory is an efficient and promising way to address charge transfer reactions. Here, we present a general and robust implementation of cDFT within the projector augmented wave (PAW) framework. PAW pseudopotentials offer a reliable frozen-core electron description across the whole periodic table, with good transferability, as well as facilitate the extraction of all-electron quantities. The present implementation is applicable to two different wave function representations, atomic-centered basis sets (LCAO) and the finite-difference (FD) approximation utilizing real-space grids. LCAO can be used for large systems, molecular dynamics, or quick initialization, while more accurate calculations are achieved with the FD basis. Furthermore, the calculations can be performed with flexible boundary conditions, ranging from isolated molecules to periodic systems in one-, two-, or three-dimensions. As such, this implementation is relevant for a wide variety of applications. We also present how to extract the electronic coupling element and reorganization energy from the resulting diabatic cDFT-PAW wave functions for the parametrization of Marcus theory. Here, the combined method is applied to important test cases where practical implementations of DFT fail due to the self-interaction error, such as the dissociation of the helium dimer cation, and it is compared to other established cDFT codes. Moreover, for charge localization in a diamine cation, where it was recently shown that the commonly used generalized gradient and hybrid functionals of DFT failed to produce the localized state, cDFT produces qualitatively and quantitatively accurate results when benchmarked against self-interaction corrected DFT and high-level CCSD(T) calculations at a fraction of the computational cost.},

They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule.

  abstract = {Recent dramatic progress in studying various two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals and their heterostructures calls for better and more detailed understanding of their crystallography, reconstruction, stacking order, etc. For this, direct imaging and identification of each and every atom is essential. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are ideal and perhaps the only tools for such studies. However, the electron beam can in some cases induce dramatic structure changes, and radiation damage becomes an obstacle in obtaining the desired information in imaging and chemical analysis in the (S)TEM. This is the case of 2D materials such as molybdenum disulfide MoS2, but also of many biological specimens, molecules, and proteins. Thus, minimizing damage to the specimen is essential for optimum microscopic analysis. In this article we demonstrate, on the example of MoS2, that encapsulation of such crystals between two layers of graphene allows for a dramatic improvement in stability of the studied 2D crystal and permits careful control over the defect nature and formation in it. We present STEM data collected from single-layer MoS2 samples prepared for observation in the microscope through three distinct procedures. The fabricated single-layer MoS2 samples were either left bare (pristine), placed atop a single-layer of graphene, or finally encapsulated between single graphene layers. Their behavior under the electron beam is carefully compared, and we show that the MoS2 sample “sandwiched” between the graphene layers has the highest durability and lowest defect formation rate compared to the other two samples, for very similar experimental conditions.},

Here, we reveal a temperature-dependent self-repair mechanism that allows near-damage-free atomic-scale sculpting of graphene using a focused electron beam. We demonstrate that by sculpting at temperatures above 600 °C, an intrinsic self-repair mechanism keeps the graphene in a single-crystalline state during cutting, even though the electron beam induces considerable damage. Self-repair is mediated by mobile carbon ad-atoms that constantly repair the defects caused by the electron beam. Our technique allows reproducible fabrication and simultaneous imaging of single-crystalline free-standing nanoribbons, nanotubes, nanopores, and single carbon chains.},

  abstract = {Developments in semiconductor technology are propelling the dimensions of devices down to 10 nm, but facing great challenges in manufacture at the sub-10 nm scale. Nanotechnology can fabricate nanoribbons from two-dimensional atomic crystals, such as graphene, with widths below the 10 nm threshold, but their geometries and properties have been hard to control at this scale. Here we find that robust ultrafine molybdenum-sulfide ribbons with a uniform width of 0.35 nm can be widely formed between holes created in a MoS2 sheet under electron irradiation. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscope characterization, combined with first-principles calculations, identifies the sub-1 nm ribbon as a Mo5S4 crystal derived from MoS2, through a spontaneous phase transition. Further first-principles investigations show that the Mo5S4 ribbon has a band gap of 0.77 eV, a Young’s modulus of 300GPa and can demonstrate 9\% tensile strain before fracture. The results show a novel top–down route for controllable fabrication of functional building blocks for sub-nanometre electronics.},

We employ non-adiabatic Ehrenfest, along with constrained density functional theory molecular dynamics, and simulate defect production in two-dimensional MoS2 under electron beam. We show that when excitations are present in the electronic system, formation of vacancies through ballistic energy transfer is possible at electron energies which are much lower than the knock-on threshold for the ground state. We further carry out TEM experiments on single layers of MoS2 at electron voltages in the range of 20–80 kV and demonstrate that indeed there is an additional channel for defect production. The mechanism involving a combination of the knock-on damage and electronic excitations we propose is relevant to other bulk and nanostructured semiconducting materials.},

Tilting the specimen lowers the threshold incident energy for displacement and leads to anisotropy in the atomic motion but has little effect on the directionally-averaged displacement rate.

  abstract = {In this paper we examine the electronic and geometrical structure of impurity-vacancy complexes in Si and Ge. Already Watkins suggested that in Si the pairing of Sn with the vacancy produces a complex with the Sn-atom at the bond center and the vacancy split into two half vacancies on the neighboring sites. Within the framework of density-functional theory we use two complementary ab initio methods, the pseudopotential-plane-wave method and the all-electron Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker method, to investigate the structure of vacancy complexes with 11 different sp-impurities. For the case of Sn in Si, we confirm the split configuration and obtain good agreement with EPR data of Watkins. In general we find that all impurities of the 5sp and 6sp series in Si and Ge prefer the split-vacancy configuration, with an energy gain of 0.5–1eV compared to the substitutional complex. On the other hand, impurities of the 3sp and 4sp series form a (slightly distorted) substitutional complex. Al impurities show an exception from this rule, forming a split complex in Si and a strongly distorted substitutional complex in Ge. We find a strong correlation of these data with the size of the isolated impurities, being defined via the lattice relaxations of the nearest neighbors.},

These achievements have been enabled by advances not only in electron optics and microscope stability but also in the preparation of suitable materials with impurity elements incorporated via ion and electron-beam irradiation or chemical means. Here it is shown that silicon heteroatoms introduced via plasma irradiation into the lattice of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can be manipulated using a focused 55–60 keV electron probe aimed at neighboring carbon sites. Moving the silicon atom mainly along the longitudinal axis of large 2.7 nm diameter tubes, more than 90 controlled lattice jumps are recorded and the relevant displacement cross sections are estimated. Molecular dynamics simulations show that even in 2 nm diameter SWCNTs, the threshold energies for out-of-plane dynamics are different than in graphene, and depend on the orientation of the silicon-carbon bond with respect to the electron beam as well as the local bonding of the displaced carbon atom and its neighbors. Atomic-level engineering of SWCNTs where the electron wave functions are more strictly confined than in 2D materials may enable the fabrication of tunable electronic resonators and other devices.},

Here, we focus on the first part by surveying the single-step dynamics of graphene dopants, primarily phosphorus, caused by electron irradiation both in experiment and simulation, and develop a theory for describing the probabilities of competing configurational outcomes depending on the postcollision momentum vector of the primary knock-on atom. The predicted branching ratio of configurational transformations agrees well with our atomically resolved experiments. This suggests a way for biasing the dynamics toward desired outcomes, paving the road for designing and further upscaling atomic engineering using electron irradiation.

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

The reader is first introduced to the basic mechanisms of radiation effects in solids with particular emphasis on atom displacements by knock-on collisions. The influence of various parameters on the displacement cross sections of carbon atoms is discussed. The types of irradiation-induced defects and their migration are described as well as ordering phenomena which are observable under the non-equilibrium conditions of irradiation. The main part of this review deals with alterations of carbon nanostructures by the electron beam in an electron microscope. This type of experiment is of paramount importance because it allows in situ observation of dynamic processes on an atomic scale. In the second part, radiation effects in the modifications of elemental carbon, in particular in graphite which forms the crystallographic basis of most carbon nanostructures, are treated in detail. It follows a review of the available experimental results on radiation defects in carbon nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes and carbon onions. Finally, the phenomena of structure formation under irradiation, in particular the self-assembling of spherical carbon onions and the irradiation-induced transformation of graphitic nanoparticles into diamond, are presented and discussed qualitatively in the context of non-equilibrium structure formation.},

The formation of the EK edge stems from sputtering and reconstruction of the zigzag edge. Density functional theory reveals minimal energy for EK edge reconstruction and bond distortion both in and out of plane, supporting our TEM observations.

Here we provide a method to control the energy transferred to the sample while facilitating much faster changes in accelerating voltages by maintaining a nearly constant temperature in the electron microscope lenses. We use this method to demonstrate in-situ nano-milling of a graphene film followed rapidly by “gentler” imaging at lower energy. Additionally, the insertion and controlled movement of silicon dopants in graphene is demonstrated by employing a different e-beam energy during each process. We believe the incorporation of variable e-beam energy will broaden the potential for atomic scale e-beam fabrication.},

Asexpected, nitrogen forms either two or three bonds with neighboring carbon atoms,with three bonds being the preferred configuration. Oxygen, by contrast, tends tobind with only two carbon atoms.

Calculated properties obtained with a gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) method and a dispersion-corrected DFT method (DFT-D3-BJ) are compared. The DFT-D3-BJ method gives better agreement with experiment for the structural parameters and Li intercalation energy compared to the uncorrected DFT approach, showing that interlayer interactions due to the van der Waals forces play an effective role in graphite and LiC6n compounds. In agreement with the literature, the calculated density of states (DOS) show that graphite is metallic with a low DOS at the Fermi level, whereas LiC6n compounds have a high DOS at the Fermi level. Between the considered point defects, VLi and Lii, the energy needed to form Li point defects is smaller if solid Li is used as reference. A moderate relaxation is observed for the atoms surrounding the Li defect. Competing pathways for Li diffusion in LiC6n compounds are investigated using the climbing-image nudged elastic band approach. Two different mechanisms for Li diffusion are observed, the vacancy mechanism and the Frenkel mechanism. For both cases, Li migration pathways along the ab plane and along the c crystallographic axis are investigated. A large activation barrier along the c crystallographic direction indicates that Li does not diffuse in the c direction. The calculated activation barriers for Li diffusion in the ab plane are consistent with previous experimental investigations.},

We developed a detection method in the STEM that is capable of recording the direction of the scattered electron beam and that is extremely sensitive to the local stacking of atoms. A comparison between experimental data and simulated models shows that the heterostructure effectively bends in the out-of-plane direction, producing an undulated structure having a periodicity that matches the moiré wavelength.

  abstract = {The mean inner potential (MIP) of a single crystal α-Al2O3 sapphire was measured using off-axis electron holography. To measure the MIP, we use mechanically polished wedge specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This approach also enabled us to measure the plasmon mean free path for inelastic scattering (IMFP). The wedge specimen, chosen here at an angle of approximately 45°, allows to determine the MIP by measuring the gradient of phase variations of the reconstructed electron wave over extended regions across the sample. The angle of the wedge was measured to an accuracy of better than 1° by two methods: first, perpendicular sectioning in a focused ion beam for direct measurement by TEM and second, by a non-destructive approach of confocal optical microscopy. The validity of this methodology was examined on a single crystal Si(001) sample showing that the mechanically polished wedge approach can be applied to a wide range of materials. Our measurements concluded that the MIP of sapphire is V0 = 16.90 ± 0.36 V. Furthermore, the IMFP of sapphire was measured at 136 ± 2 nm for 197 keV electrons with a collection angle of 18mrad. The measured MIP of sapphire reflects its degree of ionicity, which lies between theoretical calculations based on electron scattering factors of charged and neutral isolated atoms obtained by Dirac–Fock calculations. Our MIP measurements tend to the expected value for this predominantly ionic material. To account for chemical bonding and the role of the crystallographic plane at the surface of the sample, we compared the experimental measurements to density-functional-theory calculations of the MIP. Calculations of α-Al2O3 slabs cut along (0001) and (1–100) planes obtained MIP values of 15.7 V and 16.7 V, respectively.},

Recent developments in relativistic quantum theory allow for the accurate adjustment of pseudopotential parameters to valence spectra, producing results for properties of atoms, molecules, and the solid-state in excellent agreement with more accurate all-electron results if a small-core definition is used. Thus the relativistic pseudopotential approximation is now the most widely applied method for systems containing heavy elements.},

  abstract = {Two approximate methods for solving the band-structure problem in an efficient and physically transparent way are presented and discussed in detail. The variational principle for the one-electron Hamiltonian is used in both schemes, and the trial functions are linear combinations of energy-independent augmented plane waves (APW) and muffin-tin orbitals (MTO), respectively. The secular equations are therefore eigenvalue equations, linear in energy. The trial functions are defined with respect to a muffin-tin (MT) potential and the energy bands depend on the potential in the spheres through potential parameters which describe the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivatives. Inside the spheres, the energy-independent APW is that linear combination of an exact solution, at the arbitrary but fixed energy Eν, and its energy derivative which matches continuously and differentiably onto the plane-wave part in the interstitial region. The energies obtained with the linear-APW method for the MT potential have errors of order (E−Ev)4. Similarly, the energy-independent MTO is that linear combination which matches onto that solution of the Laplace equation in the interstitial region which is regular at infinity. The energies obtained with the linear-MTO method have additional errors of order (E−Vmtz)2, arising from the interstitial region where the potential is Vmtz. The linear-APW (LAPW) method combines desirable features of the APW and OPW methods; it can treat d bands, the energy dependence of its pseudopotential is linear and, owing to the smoothness of the energy-independent APW at the spheres, non-MT contributions to the potential are included principally through their Fourier components. The linear-MTO (LMTO) method is particularly suited for closely packed structures and it combines desirable features of Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker, linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals, and cellular methods; the secular matrix is linear in energy, the overlap integrals factorize as potential parameters and structure constants, the latter are canonical in the sense that they neither depend on the energy nor the cell volume and they specify the boundary conditions on a single MT or atomic sphere in the most convenient way. This method is very well suited for self-consistent calculations. The empty-lattice test is applied to the linear-MTO method and the free-electron energy bands are accurately reproduced. Finally, it is shown how relativistic effects may be included in both the LAPW and LMTO methods.},

The potential is supposed to be spherically symmetrical within spheres surrounding the atoms, constant outside. The wave function is expanded in spherical harmonics and radial solutions of the wave equation within the spheres, and in plane waves outside the spheres, joining continuously at the surface. A single unperturbed function consists of a single plane wave outside the spheres, together with the necessary spherical functions within the spheres. The matrix components of energy are set up between these unperturbed functions, and the secular equation set up. This equation involves the energy explicitly, and also implicitly through the ratio of the slope of the various radial functions to the functions themselves at the surfaces of the spheres, and must be solved numerically. It is hoped that the method will be useful for comparatively low energy excited electrons, for which the usual method of expansion in plane waves converges too slowly.},

The detector has a large dynamic range, narrow point spread function, detective quantum efficiency ≥ 0.8 even without single electron arrival discrimination, and it is resilient to radiation damage. It is capable of detecting {\textasciitilde}5 × 106 electrons/pixel/second, allowing it to accommodate up to 0.8 pA per pixel and hence {\textgreater}100 pA EELS zero-loss peak (ZLP) without saturation, if the ZLP is spread over {\textgreater}125 pixels (in the non-dispersion direction). At the same time, it can reliably detect isolated single electrons in the high loss region of the spectrum. The detector uses a selectable threshold to exclude low energy events, and this results in essentially zero dark current and readout noise. Its maximum frame readout rate at 16-bit digitization is 2250 full frames per second, allowing for fast spectrum imaging. We show applications including EELS of boron nitride in which an unsaturated zero loss peak is recorded at the same time as inner shell loss edges, elemental mapping of an STO/BTO/LMSO multilayer, and efficient parallel acquisition of angle-resolved EEL spectra (S(q, ω)) of boron nitride.},

Starting from a survey of fundamental phenomena, the authors introduce the most important concepts underlying modern understanding of high energy electron diffraction. Dynamical diffraction in transmission (THEED) and reflection (RHEED) geometries is treated using a general matrix theory, where computer programs and worked examples are provided to illustrate the concepts and to familiarize the reader with practical applications. Diffuse and inelastic scattering and coherence effects are treated comprehensively both as a perturbation of elastic scattering and within the general multiple scattering quantum mechanical framework of the density matrix method. Among the highlights are the treatment of resonance diffraction of electrons, HOLZ diffraction, the formation of Kikuchi bands and lines and ring patterns, and application of diffraction to monitoring of growing surfaces. Useful practical data are summarised in tables including those of electron scattering factors for all the neutral atoms and many ions, and the temperature dependent Debye-Waller factors given for over 100 elemental crystals and compounds.},

In many cases, the quantitative interpretation of images requires simulations based on atomistic structure models. These typically use the independent atom approximation that neglects bonding effects, which may, however, be measurable and of physical interest. Since all electrons and the nuclear cores contribute to the scattering potential, simulations that go beyond this approximation have relied on computationally highly demanding all-electron calculations. Here, we describe a new method to generate ab initio electrostatic potentials when describing the core electrons by projector functions. Combined with an interface to quantitative image simulations, this implementation enables an easy and fast means to model electron scattering. We compare simulated transmission electron microscopy images and diffraction patterns to experimental data, showing an accuracy equivalent to earlier all-electron calculations at a much lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {The ability to control matter at the atomic scale and build devices with atomic precision is central to nanotechnology. The scanning tunnelling microscope1 can manipulate individual atoms2 and molecules on surfaces, but the manipulation of silicon to make atomic-scale logic circuits has been hampered by the covalent nature of its bonds. Resist-based strategies have allowed the formation of atomic-scale structures on silicon surfaces3, but the fabrication of working devices—such as transistors with extremely short gate lengths4, spin-based quantum computers5,6,7,8 and solitary dopant optoelectronic devices9—requires the ability to position individual atoms in a silicon crystal with atomic precision. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy and hydrogen-resist lithography to demonstrate a single-atom transistor in which an individual phosphorus dopant atom has been deterministically placed within an epitaxial silicon device architecture with a spatial accuracy of one lattice site. The transistor operates at liquid helium temperatures, and millikelvin electron transport measurements confirm the presence of discrete quantum levels in the energy spectrum of the phosphorus atom. We find a charging energy that is close to the bulk value, previously only observed by optical spectroscopy10.},

  abstract = {The London dispersion forces, along with the Debye and Keesom forces, constitute the long-range van der Waals forces. London's and Hamaker's work on the point-to-point dispersion interaction and Lifshitz's development of the continuum theory of dispersion are the foundations of our understanding of dispersion forces. Dispersion forces are present for all materials and are intrinsically related to the optical properties and the underlying interband electronic structures of materials. The force law scaling constant of the dispersion force, known as the Hamaker constant, can be determined from spectral or parametric optical properties of materials, combined with knowledge of the configuration of the materials. With recent access to new experimental and ab initio tools for determination of optical properties of materials, dispersion force research has new opportunities for detailed studies. Opportunities include development of improved index approximations and parametric representations of the optical properties for estimation of Hamaker constants. Expanded databases of London dispersion spectra of materials will permit accurate estimation of both nonretarded and retarded dispersion forces in complex configurations. Development of solutions for generalized multilayer configurations of materials are needed for the treatment of more-complex problems, such as graded interfaces. Dispersion forces can play a critical role in materials applications. Typically, they are a component with other forces in a force balance, and it is this balance that dictates the resulting behavior. The ubiquitous nature of the London dispersion forces makes them a factor in a wide spectrum of problems; they have been in evidence since the pioneering work of Young and Laplace on wetting, contact angles, and surface energies. Additional applications include the interparticle forces that can be measured by direct techniques, such as atomic force microscopy. London dispersion forces are important in both adhesion and in sintering, where the detailed shape at the crack tip and at the sintering neck can be controlled by the dispersion forces. Dispersion forces have an important role in the properties of numerous ceramics that contain intergranular films, and here the opportunity exists for the development of an integrated understanding of intergranular films that encompasses dispersion forces, segregation, multilayer adsorption, and structure. The intrinsic length scale at which there is a transition from the continuum perspective (dispersion forces) to the atomistic perspective (encompassing interatomic bonds) is critical in many materials problems, and the relationship of dispersion forces and intergranular films may represent an important opportunity to probe this topic. The London dispersion force is retarded at large separations, where the transit time of the electromagnetic interaction must be considered explicitly. Novel phenomena, such as equilibrium surficial films and bimodal wetting/dewetting, can result in materials systems when the characteristic wavelengths of the interatomic bonds and the physical interlayer thicknesses lead to a change in the sign of the dispersion force. Use of these novel phenomena in future materials applications provides interesting opportunities in materials design.},

  abstract = {The atomic structure of nanomaterials is often studied using transmission electron microscopy. In addition to image formation, the energetic electrons impinging on the sample may also cause damage. In a good conductor such as graphene, the damage is limited to the knock-on process caused by elastic electron-nucleus scattering. This process is determined by the kinetic energy an atom needs to be sputtered, i.e. its displacement threshold energy Ed. This is typically assumed to have a fixed value for all electron impacts on equivalent atoms within a crystal. Here we show using density functional tight-binding simulations that the displacement threshold energy is affected by thermal perturbations of atoms from their equilibrium positions. This effect can be accounted for in the estimation of the displacement cross section by replacing the constant threshold energy value with a distribution. Our refined model better describes previous precision measurements of graphene knock-on damage, and should be considered also for other low-dimensional materials.},

By adopting a low feeding rate of 4 µl min−1, the fabricated TCFs present one of the lowest sheet resistances of ca 78 Ω sq.−1. at 90\% transmittance. Optical characterizations demonstrate that the mean diameter of high-quality SWCNTs is up to 2 nm. Additionally, electron microcopy observations provide evidence that the mean length of SWCNT bundles is as long as 28.4 µm while the mean bundle diameter is only 5.3 nm. Moreover, very few CNT loops can be found in the film. Remarkably, the fraction of individual SWCNTs reaches 24.6\%. All those morphology data account for the superior optoelectronic performance of our SWCNT TCFs.},

Theoretically, the π magnetism induced by the monovacancy in graphene is characteristic of two spin-split density-of-states (DOS) peaks close to the Dirac point. Since its prediction, many experiments have attempted to study this π magnetism in graphene, whereas only a notable resonance peak has been observed around the atomic defects, leaving the π magnetism experimentally elusive. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of π magnetism by using a scanning tunneling microscope. We demonstrate that the localized state of the atomic defects is split into two DOS peaks with energy separations of several tens of meV. Strong magnetic fields further increase the energy separations of the two spin-polarized peaks and lead to a Zeeman-like splitting. Unexpectedly, the effective g factor around the atomic defect is measured to be about 40, which is about 20 times larger than the g factor for electron spins.},

  abstract = {Graphene, a one-atom thick sheet of carbon, is the thinnest, strongest and most electrically conductive material ever discovered. Alongside carbon nanotubes it is part of the group of nanocarbons whose unique properties have sparked huge interest in possible applications, including electronic devices, solar cells and biosensors. Doping of these materials allows for the modification of their optical and electronic properties,which is crucial to realising these applications. Studying the properties of these doped materials at atomic resolution and finding controllable and industrially scalable routes to doping, such as low energy ion implantation, are thus essential if they are to becomethe materials of the future.In this thesis, highly localised optical enhancements in metal doped graphene are studied using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy in a monochromated and aberration corrected electron microscope. The ideal conditions for imaging the low energy loss region of graphene using EFTEM are discussed and new methods to compensate for image artifacts when using this technique at high resolution are presented. Density functional theory is used to reveal new visible spectrum plasmon excitations in the electron energy loss spectra of boron and nitrogen doped nanocarbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale electron energy loss spectroscopy are used to investigate controllable and defect-free substitutional doping of suspended graphene films through low energy ion implantation.Computational methods for filtering high angle annular dark field images are shown and software for the automated processing and spectroscopic analysis of these images is developed.},

  abstract = {The structure and oxidation state of self-assembled nanostructures formed by oxidation of aniline with ammonium persulfate in the presence of alanine have been investigated by solid-state C-13 and N-15 NMR, FTIR, GPC, elemental, UV-vis, and SEM methods. These techniques have been applied to samples obtained 1 and 20 h after the beginning of the reaction in their doped as-synthesized form or after reduction with hydrazine or dedopin g with NH4OH or LiOH. Peaks at 66 and 72 ppm and a peak at 241 ppm in the N-15 NMR spectra are shifted downfield by about 1-6 ppm and upfield by about 80 ppm, respectively, relative to the positions expected for the amine and imine N atoms in polyaniline. This indicates a difference in molecular structure between the nanotube material and standard polyaniline. This may be attributed to the presence of either strong H-bonding or a fundamentally different bonding connectivity in the nanotube material. Despite the significant difference in morphology of the samples after 1 and 20 h as shown by SEM, the C-13 and N-15 spectra show resonances at very similar chemical shifts for the two reaction times. The differences in line width and intensity of the peaks in these spectra are attributed to an increased number of positive charges and to longer polymer chains for the longer reaction time. The previously postulated presence of phenazine-like units in the molecular structure within the nanotubes cannot be excluded due to possible overlapping of resonances from amine and tertiary nitrogens in the N-15 NMR spectra. The carbon and nitrogen NMR spectra show that the alanine is not incorporated into the aniline oxidation products. Chemical structures whose presence is consistent with the data obtained from solid-state NMR and the other methods applied in this work are proposed.},

N-doping was achieved via ion beam implantation, and Pt was electrodeposited from solutions of H2PtCl6 in aqueous HClO4. Morphology from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and catalytic activity measurement from aqueous electrochemical analysis were utilized to examine the N-doping effects. The results strongly support the theory that doping nitrogen into a graphite support significantly affects both the morphology and behavior of the overlying Pt nanoparticles. In particular, nitrogen-doping was observed to cause a significant decrease in the average Pt nanoparticle size, an increase in the Pt nanoparticle dispersion, and a significant increase in catalytic activity for both methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction.},

  abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays have been produced on silicon substrate by an one-step route based on the pyrolysis of mixture of ferrocene and melamine under well-chosen synthesis condition. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies showed the products were all multi-walled CNTs that are about 50 nm in diameter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study revealed that the CNTs were nitrogen-doped. Field effect transistors (FETs) base on the nitrogen-doped MWCNT in an asymmetry-source/drain-electrodes configuration were further fabricated. And electrical transport measurements exhibited typical n-type behavior. The off-state current through the FETs is extremely low, about 100 pA in order. The asymmetry isolation layer between the source/drain electrodes and the gate used in the experiment results in asymmetric modulation of gate electrostatic field to source electrode and drain electrode. Therefore solo gate electrostatic field modulation to the drain electrode is realized.},

  abstract = {We report a spin-polarized density-functional theory study of electric-field effects on the electronic and spin properties of graphene nanodots. Both undoped and graphene nanodots doped with nitrogen and boron are considered. In the presence of nonlocal exchange-correlation interactions, undoped graphene nanodots are found to be half-semiconductors when a weak electric field is applied across the zigzag edge. At high electric fields these graphene nanodots become nonmagnetic semiconductors. When the electric field is applied across the armchair edge, these graphene nanodots maintain an antiferromagnetic ground state with the energy gap strongly dependent on the magnitude of the electric field. For graphene nanodots doped with nitrogen or boron we find that energetically the most favorable state among all possible configurations is the one in which the dopant replaces the carbon atom at the center of the zigzag edge. The substitutional dopant atom at the zigzag edge leads to a spin-polarized half-semiconducting state in which the spin degeneracy is broken. The spin-dependent energy gaps can be tuned within a wide range by applying electric fields. In addition, we find the half-semiconducting state under doping occurs even when the electric field is very strong. This indicates that edge doping can significantly widen the operating range of applied electric fields for spintronic applications because undoped graphene nanodots become spinless semiconductors under certain applied electric fields.},

In this paper, iron doped boehmite nanofibres, nanotubes and nanosheets with varying iron content have been prepared through low temperature hydrothermal treatment in the presence of poly (ethylene oxide) surfactant. The combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and N-2 adsorption were employed to characterize the resulting nanostructures. TEM images showed that the resulting nanostructures are predominantly nanofibres when iron content is less than 5\% (mol/mol); in contrast nanosheets were formed when iron doping was above 5\%. Nanotubes instead of nanofibres and iron rich particles were observed in samples with 20\% added iron. XRD showed that the iron doped nanostructures are boehmite (gamma-AlOOH), with EDX analysis indicating the maximum iron content in the boehmite nanostructures is about 4.3\%. Nitrogen adsorption results indicate a lowering of the surface area for the iron doped phase in comparison to that of undoped boehmite nanofibres. Further study is required to determine the magnetic and optical properties of the iron doped boehmite nanostructures for their prospective applications. A detailed characterization of the iron doped nanofibres is presented.},

Here, we reported a glucose biosensor based on electrochemical pretreatment of non-doped nanocrystalline diamond (N-NCD) modified gold electrode for the selective detection of glucose. N-NCD was coated on gold electrode and glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized onto the surfaces of N-NCD by forming amide linkages between enzyme amine residues and carboxylic acid groups on N-NCD. The anodic pretreatment of N-NCD modified electrode not only promoted the electron transfer rate in the N-NCD thin film, but also resulted in a dramatic improvement in the reduction of the dissolved oxygen. This performance could be used to detect glucose at negative potential through monitoring the current change of oxygen reduction. The biosensor effectively performs a selective electrochemical analysis of glucose in the presence of common interferents, such as ascorbic acid (AA), acetaminophen (AP) and uric acid (UA). A wide linear calibration range from 10 mu M to 15 mM and a low detection limit of 5 mu M were achieved for the detection of glucose. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Microscopic measurements show that boron, like nitrogen, incorporates into the carbon lattice primarily in the graphitic form and contributes 0.5 carriers into the graphene sheet per dopant. Density functional theory calculations indicate that boron dopants interact strongly with the underlying substrate while nitrogen dopants do not. The local bonding differences between graphitic boron and nitrogen dopants lead to large scale differences in dopant distribution. The distribution of dopants is observed to be completely random in the case of boron, while nitrogen displays strong sublattice clustering. Structurally, nitrogen-doped graphene is relatively defect-free while boron-doped graphene films show a large number of Stone-Wales defects. These defects create local electronic resonances and cause electronic scattering, but do not electronically dope the graphene film.},

We find that the formation energies of 4ND defects in the (n, 0) CNT are always smaller than those of the (n, n) CNT, suggesting that the formers might be easily formed. For (n, n) CNTs, the formation energies of 4ND defect are nearly independent of the tube diameters for s, while the values increase monotonically with the increased tube diameters in (n, 0) CNTs. Furthermore, the incorporation of 4ND structures to the CNT introduces the acceptor states to the band structures, resulting in the decrease of the band gaps of pure CNTs in various ways. By studying the hydrogen adsorption on the Ca-dispersed CNx nanotube with 4ND structures, we suggest that up to five H2 molecules can be bound to per Ca atom with the adsorption energy of ���������������������0.263 eV.

(1) For pure carbon nanotubes, we have identified the energetically most favorable dissociative pathway for hydrogen adsorption, with a barrier height of 1.3 eV. We also found that the adsorbed hydrogen atoms can act as an autocatalyst for further dissociative adsorption of hydrogen molecules. (2) It is found that on pure carbon nanotubes the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is constrained by interaction with neighboring adsorbed hydrogen atoms. The diffusion barrier is around 0.7 eV for an isolated hydrogen atom, but becomes substantially higher at around 1.4 eV in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen in neighboring positions. (3) Doping the nanotube with nitrogen considerably alters the catalytic effects of the carbon nanotube for hydrogen dissociative adsorption. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the carbon nanotube is greatly enhanced, with the barrier substantially reduced to ca. 0.9 eV. The differences in the barrier heights are explained through analysis of the electronic structure changes of the nanotube.},

In contrast to Derycke et al's results (2002 Appl. Phys.

Besides, introducing dislocations is also a possible accommodation mechanism for the strains produced between the successive tube surfaces. Reciprocal space constructions have been accomplished for explaining the diffraction effects for non-helical tubes as well as for helical ones. Well-resolved high-resolution images are obtained in particular for the non-helical tubes and the image features could be confirmed by computer simulations.

A potential of 20-30 V and a current of 100-140 A ac were applied between two pure graphite rods in the chamber. Nitrogen-doped fullerenes were discovered in soot and characterized by laser desorption mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both C-60(-) and C59N- can be observed on laser desorption mass spectrometry. In addition, a series of nitrogen-substituted carbon cluster anions appear on low-mass section bf the mass spectrum. The XPS result also confirms the existence of nitrogen-doped fullerenes. Spectral peaks of C(1s) and N(1s) with binding energies of 288. 1 eV and 402. 8 eV can be distinguished. The latter has a single sharp feature, differing significantly from N, adsorbed on a C-60 film, which produces a spectral peak near 400. 2 eV. Carbon nanotubes were observed in deposit. The deposit formed in a nitrogen atmosphere is much richer in carbon nanotubes than that formed in a helium or argon atmosphere. The carbon nanotubes were investigated by transmission electron microscopy(TEM). Some unusual structural patterns of carbon nanotubes have been observed from the TEM images. In addition, nanocrystals were observed by TEM after the deposit was treated in the corrosive solution. The nanocrystals may be C3N4.},

The energy calculated for each ORR step shows that the ORR can spontaneously occur on the N-graphene. The active catalytical sites on single nitrogen doped graphene are identified, which have either high positive spin density or high positive atomic charge density. The nitrogen doping introduces asymmetry spin density and atomic charge density, making it possible for N-graphene to show high electroncatalytic activities for the ORR.},

When two nitrogen atoms are introduced into the (5, 5), (6, 6) and (7, 4) tubes, nitrogen atoms prefer to be adjacent to each other along the circumference, while they tend to be far from each other in other carbon nanotubes. As more nitrogen atoms are incorporated, they prefer to be localized, leading to the broken N-N bond and the interstice is formed in the thin tubes. However, for thick tubes, nitrogen atoms tend to distribute uniformly. It is the finding in this work that the high radial stress plays an important role in nitrogen atom distribution for the thin tubes.

The results show the Young's moduli of armchair (5, 5) (10, 10) and zigzag (9, 0) (18, 0) SWCNTs with no impurities to be 948 GPa, 901 GPa and 804 GPa, 860 GPa, respectively. When the armchair SWCNTs are doped with BN, their Young's modulus decreases slightly. However, an increase in the doping ratio beyond a certain point does not cause any further reduction in the modulus, which continues to fluctuate at about 800 GPa and 760 GPa, respectively. The zigzag SWCNTs behave somewhat differently. When they are doped with BN, their Young's moduli drop quickly, and then rise as the doping ratio increases until it reaches 100\% (i. e. boron nitride nanotubes are formed), at which point the Young's moduli of the nanotubes are 780 GPa and 835 GPa, respectively, 97\% that of the corresponding pure SWCNTs. The effect of a high ratio of BN on zigzag SWCNTs is thus negligible. The reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed according to the law of electron cloud coupling between two atoms, which comes from the local density approximation (LDA) and is based on density functional theory (DFT).},

Methane decomposition was catalyzed by Fe/MgO and Fe-Mo/MgO catalysts in argon, nitrogen and their mixtures. Nitrogen influences the carbon species significantly. The aggregation of iron nanoparticles in nitrogen results in the growth of N-doped carbon nanofibers on the Fe/MgO catalyst. A limited iron nanoparticle aggregation in nitrogen occurred on a Fe-Mo/MgO catalyst, on which there was an increase in the diameter of the SWNTs as the reaction atmosphere was more enriched in nitrogen, which was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. These results provide an experimental basis for the rational selection of the reaction atmosphere, and suggest an approach to control the size of the SWNTs in a CVD method.

  abstract = {The electrochemical properties of LaNi5 electrodes doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) treated at different temperatures in a nitrogen atmosphere were investigated. The MWNTs were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The purified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were annealed during 1.5h in a nitrogen atmosphere at different temperatures. A three-electrode system was applied. The CNTs-LaNi5 electrodes were prepared by mixing CNTs and LaNi5 in a weight ratio of 1:10, and used as the working electrode; Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH worked as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A 6 mol/L KOH solution acted as the electrolyte. MWNTs annealed at different temperatures in a nitrogen atmosphere showed large differences in the electrochemical hydrogen storage capability under the same testing condition. The CNTs-LaNi5 electrodes with 20-40nm diameter CNTs heated at 800 degrees C in nitrogen proved to have the best electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity, with a discharging capacity of 519.1 mAh/g and a corresponding discharging plateau voltage of 1.18 V, at a 200 mA/g charge current density and a 60 Ma/g discharge current density with a 0.2V discharge voltage limit. From 500 to 800 degrees C, the higher the annealing temperature,the better the electrochemical hydrogen storage property. However, CNTs-LaNi5 electrodes with 20-40nm diameter CNTs heated at 900 degrees C in nitrogen have a lower capacity of 476.2 mAh/g under the same testing condition. This shows that the annealing temperature of CNTs is an important factor that influences their electrochemical hydrogen storage performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This can be explained by carbon substitution, which is a more direct substitution process with the nano-C precursor. With CNT doping, carbon substitution only occurred after break out of carbon atoms from CNT. Both dopants showed significant enhancement in both magnetic critical current density, J(c)(H), and transport critical current at high sintering temperature like 900 degrees C.

The inner carbon layer (or the outer carbon layer) of the double coaxial carbon nanotubes is free from N, while the outer carbon layer (or the inner carbon layer) is uniformly doped with N. Transmission electron microscopy cannot differentiate between the outer and inner layers, but all the results by Raman, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provide evidence that the N-doped layer is less crystallized than the undoped one. Furthermore, the N-doped layer has apparently higher chemical reactivity toward oxygen than the undoped one due to more edge-active sites resulting from the introduction of nitrogen species. Electrical conductance measurement indicates that despite poorer crystallinity the N-doped layer has higher conductivity than undoped one. The resulting multiwalled carbon nanotubes thus have not only double-stack coaxial structure but also dual physicochemical properties.},

The nitrogen content varies between 3.0 and 7.9 wt.\% depending on the zeolite template and CVD temperature. The carbon materials generally retain the particle morphology of the zeolite templates. However, when the CVD is performed at temperatures,{\textgreater}= 900 degrees C, hollow carbon shells that are hexagonal, cubic, or rectangular in shape are obtained as the predominant particle morphology. High CVD temperatures ({\textgreater}= 950 degrees C) also result in greater proportions of graphitic carbon.

It is thus possible by choice of zeolite template and CVD conditions to nanocast N-doped carbon materials that exhibit hollow-cored particle morphology, high surface area ({\textgreater}2000 m(2)/g) and zeolite-type pore channel ordering or hollow shells with significant levels of graphitization.

In the present study, we revealed that the conduction mechanisms in nanotube networks formed by high-purity metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs are completely different. Quantum transport was observed in macroscopic networks of pure metallic SWCNTs. However, for semiconducting SWCNT networks, Coulomb-gap-type conduction was observed, due to Coulomb interactions between localized electrons. Crossovers among a weakly localized state and strongly localized states with and without Coulomb interactions were observed for transport electrons by varying the relative content of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs. It was found that hopping barriers, which always exist in normal SWCNT networks and are serious obstacles to achieving high conductivity, were not present in pure metallic SWCNT networks.},

The bamboo-shaped carbon-nitrogen nanotubes were synthesized by spray pyrolysis of Fe(C5H5)(2) and CH3CN solution using argon as a carrier gas at the optimum temperature of \&SIM; 900 \&DEG; C. The effect of ferrocene concentration on the length and concentration of nitrogen in nanotubes was studied. Micro-structural features of the nanotubes were monitored employing scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. SEM studies reveal that with decreasing ferrocene concentration from 25 mg ml(-1) to 5 mg ml(-1), the length of the nanotubes vary from 80 \&mu; m to 430 \&mu; m. A feasible growth model has been described and discussed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies have confirmed the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. These studies reveal that the nitrogen concentration in the nanotubes decreases with the increase of ferrocene concentration. The present synthesis route also provides means of producing carbon nanotubes with different concentrations of nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Discoveries of superconductivity of MgB2 by Akimitsu et al. and highTc cupurate superconductors by Bednorz and Muller have raised great interest for elucidation of the superconducting mechanism from both experimental and theoretical grounds. The transition temperature (T-c) was found to be 40 K for MgB2, while the very high-T-c over 130 K was reported for doped copper oxides with layer structures. A crucial role of the electron-phonon (EP) interaction was pointed out as a common mechanism of-the superconductivity of both materials. However, such high-T-c superconductivity may indicate the possibility of cooperative mechanism of the EP interaction with others such as electron correlation (EC) and multiband (MB) effects discussed in part I (Int J Quantum Chem 1990, 37, 167) of this series. Here, as a continuation of part I, theoretical backgrounds are briefly described to select active orbital space for superconductivity and elucidate the nature of EP, EC, and MB effects for cooperative mechanisms. Next, molecular orbital calculations of MgmBn and cagetype carbon cluster are carried out to elucidate contributions of the EP interaction using McMillan equation. The relative contributions of the EP and EC interactions are also discussed in relation to the screening of the Coulomb repulsion. Pair binding energies are calculated for cage-type carbon clusters. Finally, the cooperative mechanisms of the EP, EC, and MB effects are discussed to realize the high-T-c superconductivity in molecule-based materials such as cage compounds and nanotubes. Several possible candidates are proposed on both experimental and theoretical grounds. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Formation of gaseous products was followed by gas chromatography. Boosting the radical concentration in the gas phase by adding acetone increased the rate of formation of carbon. The carbon deposit was found to inhibit the formation of gaseous products by a heterogeneous termination process. HNO3, HF, LiOH/KOH/H3BO3, and Li3PO4/K3PO4, were used to treat the quartz surface of the reactor. Washing the reactor with HF solution almost eliminated both the formation of nanotubes on the surface and the resulting inhibition of the formation of gaseous products. Acetylene and intermediates formed directly from acetylene were shown to be the main precursors of the formation of carbon nanotubes.},

Previous mechanisms reported in the literature to describe the observed voltammetry are critically assessed and an alternative mechanistic interpretation is presented involving evidence for surface adsorption of intermediate species in the redox behaviour of methylviologen (MV) rather than any disproportionation or comproportionation as was previously claimed for the specific case of gold electrodes. Various electrodes were then modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) where the formation of solid MV0 on the electrode surface was prevented due to preferential adsorption of MV0 on the MWCNTs. Thus coating an electrode with MWCNTs can protect the electrode surface from “fouling”, providing scope for diffusion dominated voltammetry at electrodes where surface inhibition has hitherto dominated.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {Abstract Density functional theory calculations are used to study the healing process of a defective CNT (i.e. (8,0) CNT) by CO molecules. The healing undergoes three evolutionary steps: 1) the chemisorption of the first CO molecule, 2) the incorporation of the C atom of CO into the CNT, accompanied by the adsorption of the leaving O atom on the CNT surface, 3) the removal of the adsorbed O atom from the CNT surface by a second CO molecule to form CO2 and the perfect CNT. Overall, adsorption of the first CO reveals a barrier of 2.99 kcal���������mol���������1 and is strongly exothermal by 109.11 kcal���������mol���������1, while adsorption of a second CO has an intrinsic barrier of 32.37 kcal���������mol���������1and is exothermal by 62.34 kcal���������mol���������1. In light of the unique conditions of CNT synthesis, that is, high temperatures in a closed container, the healing of the defective CNT could be effective in the presence of CO molecules. Therefore, we propose that among the available CNT synthesis procedures, the good performance of chemical vapor decomposition of CO on metal nanoparticles might be ascribed to the dual role of CO, that is, CO acts both as a carbon source and a defect healer. The present results are expected to help a deeper understanding of CNT growth.},

However, without calculations it is hard to determine the spin multiplicity of some complex systems, such as many magnetic nanostuctures and some inorganic or bioinorganic molecules. Here we give a general prescription to obtain the spin-unrestricted ground state of open-shell systems. Our methods are implemented into the linear-scaling trace-correcting density-matrix purification algorithm. The numerical atomic-orbital basis, rather than the commonly adopted Gaussian basis functions, is used. The test systems include O-2 molecule and magnetic carbon-doped boron nitride (BN)(5,5) and BN(7,6) nanotubes. Using the newly developed method, we find that the magnetic moments in carbon-doped BN nanotubes couple antiferromagnetically with each other.

  abstract = {The synthesis and characterization of porous graphitic carbon materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using various mesoporous silicas including SBA-12, SBA-15, MCM-48, MCM-41, and HMS as solid templates is presented. The use of acetonitrile as carbon precursor generates N-doped carbon (CNx type;, materials with nitrogen content of ca. 8 wt \%. The N-doped carbon materials exhibit both well-ordered mesoporosity and high levels of graphitic character. The mesostructural ordering and extent of graphitization depend on the CVD (i.e., carbonization) temperature and the nature of the silica template. In general, higher CVD temperatures ({\textgreater}900 degrees C) generated high levels of graphitic character but compromised the mesostructural ordering of the carbon materials. The mesostructural ordering of the CNx materials (and replication of pore channel ordering from the silica template) depends on the nature of the mesoporous silica used as solid template. We achieved structural replication and high surface area (440-1000 m(2)/g) CNx materials from SBA-12, MCM-48, and SBA-15 silica templates. MCM-41 and HMS; silicas did not function effectively as templates and generated low surface area ({\textless}320 m(2)/g) CNx materials. The particle morphology of the silica template was in all cases replicated in the carbon materials, and we observed hollow particles for samples prepared at CVD temperature of 1000 degrees C or higher.},

The Pt atom tends to occupy the axial bridge site of the BN tube with the highest binding energy of -0.91 eV. Upon Pt doping, several occupied and unoccupied impurity states are induced, which reduces the band gap of the pristine BN nanotube. Upon hydrogen adsorption on Pt-doped BN nanotube, the first hydrogen molecule can be chemically adsorbed on the Pt-doped BN nanotube without crossing any energy barrier, whereas the second hydrogen molecule has to overcome a small energy barrier of 0.019 eV. At least up to two hydrogen molecules can be chemically adsorbed on a single Pt atom supported by the BN nanotube, with the average adsorption energy of -0.365 eV. Upon hydrogen adsorption on a Pt-dimer-doped BN nanotube, the formation of the Pt dimer not only weakens the interaction between the Pt cluster and the BN nanotube but also reduces the average adsorption energy of hydrogen molecules. These calculation results can be useful in the assessment of metal-doped BN nanotubes as potential hydrogen storage media. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

In this study, titania thin films with a dual structure, that is, flower-like rutile aggregates sitting on top of an anatase layer, were fabricated simply by oxidizing metallic Ti plates with hydrogen peroxide solution containing trace amounts of hexamethylenetetramine and concentrated nitric acid at 353 K for 72 h. Low-temperature growth of the top flower-like rutile, with constructing blocks of tiny rutile nanorods, occurred only after 60 h of reaction when the solution contained almost no hydrogen peroxide or Ti(IV) ions. Tiny rutile nanorods were supposed to form through a dissolution precipitation mechanism and then orient and attach to form single-crystal nanorods with larger sizes, which self-organize to develop the flower-like rutile aggregates. After a subsequent thermal treatment to further improve the crystallinity, the titania film was utilized to assist photodegradation of Rhodamine B in water under ultraviolet light irradiation. Significant increased photocatalytic activity of the titania nanoflower film was achieved after natural aging of the titania thin film for certain durations. The present film possessed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with the titania nanorod film we previously reported and the commercial Degussa P-25 titania coating as well.},

The nitrogen content onto carbon can be adjusted up to 5.1 at.\% by changing the coverage of polyaniline. The effects of nitrogen doping on the Surface physical and electrochemical properties of carbon were studied using XPS, XRD and HRTEM, as well as CV and EIS techniques. With increasing nitrogen doping, the carbon structure became more compact, showing curvatures and dislocations in the graphene stacking. The nitrogen-doped carbon also exhibited a higher accessible surface area in electrochemical reactions, and a lower charge transfer resistance at the carbon/electrolyte interface. Moreover, to investigate the influence of nitrogen doping on the electrocatalytic activity of the PtRu/C catalyst, comparisons in CO stripping and methanol oxidation were carried out on PtRu catalysts supported by non-doped and nitrogen -doped carbon. Since the promotional roles of nitrogen doping, including the high electrochemically accessible Surface area, the richness of the disordered nanostructures and defects, and the high electron density on N-doped carbon supports, contribute to the synthesis of well-dispersed PtRu particles with high Pt utilization and stronger metal-support interactions, an enhanced catalytic activity for methanol oxidation was obtained in the case of the PtRu/N-C catalyst in comparison with the traditional PtRu/C catalyst.

TiO2 NWs were also examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, which demonstrated that the NWs grew along the [110] axis as single crystalline. Adding nitrogen (N) during the growth process enabled n-doped TiO2 NWs to be synthesized. The luminescence characteristics and the doping effect of TiO2 NWs were studied by cathodoluminescence (CL) in FESEM at room temperature. The CL spectra revealed a broad blue band of similar to 402 nm (3.08 eV) for undoped NWs and one of 439 nm (2.82 eV) for n-doped NWs, respectively. (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

Bundling of tubes is shown to have little effect on the phonon frequencies. However, arranging tubes in a large periodic array (larger than the wavelength of incoming light) gives rise to a strong frequency shift (longitudinal-optical-transverse-optical splitting) of certain modes due to the establishing of a macroscopic electric field.

Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for hBN leads to optical absorption and loss spectra where the positions and shapes of the peaks are strongly dominated by excitonic effects. The binding energy of the first exciton is about 0.71 eV. Comparison of the calculations with recently measured optical absorption and EELS demonstrates that DFT underestimates the “true” band gap of BN by 2.25 eV. This band gap difference can be partially (hot not completely) reproduced by a calculation of the quasi-particle band-structure on the level of the GW-approximation. We show, how the lower dimensionality of BN nanotubes leads to a much stronger excitonic binding energy and at the same time to a larger quasi-particle gap. This leaves the position of the first absorption peak almost unchanged. However, the difference in the series of excitonic peaks allows the spectroscopic distinction between BN nanotubes and bulk BN.},

  abstract = {It has been reported that MgB2 lost its superconductivity when doped with 40 at.\% Al. Here, we report on the influence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the structure and superconductivity of MgB2-CNTs composites. The lattice parameters of MgB2 with 10 at.\% CNTs are a = 0.30815 nm and c = 0.35322 nm, slightly different from those of the pure MgB2, which indicates that carbon atoms may have substituted boron atoms in MgB2. The transition temperature of the samples decreases as the CNTs content increases. However, the samples added with about 40 at.\% CNTs still have a transition temperature of 24 K. When added with bulk CNTs (between 20 and 40 at.\%), the samples present a semiconductor behavior in the high-temperature region (above 40 K) and have superconductivity at low temperature; (below 32 K).

  abstract = {Two-step hydrothermal method was developed to prepare B-doped TiO2 nanotubes (BTNTs). BTNTs was characterized by TEM, XRD, XPS, FT-IR UV-Vis spectroscopy, its photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution both under UV light and visible light irritation. The results from TEM indicated that BTNTs with diameter of 10-20 nm and length of several AM was successfully prepared by two-step hydrothermal reaction. The XRD revealed that the BTNTs had crystalline structure of anatase. Especially, the photocatalytic tests Indicated that the BTNTs showed higher photocatalytic activity, the degradation of MO were 99.8\% and 90.6\% under UV light Irritation for 90 min and sunlight (55klux) irritation for 100 min, respectively. FT-IR and XPS results showed that doped boron was present as the form of B3+ in BTNTS forming a possible chemical environment like Ti-O-B. Boron atoms can substitute oxygen atoms in the TiO2 lattice, which causes the band gap narrowing and extend its light absorption into the visible region. Moreover, large specific surface area and one-dimensional structure of BTNTs may be contributed to the greater absorption to organic pollutants and lower combination of electron hole pairs. The synergetic effect of B-doped and one-dimensional tubular structure leads to a higher photoactivity of BTNTs. Additionally, the BTNTs could be easily separated from the reaction solution by sedimentation. These results show that BTNTs will provide possibility to future Industrial applications in environmental pollutants cleaning up.},

This paper is devoted to the investigation of the formation mechanism of the Si3N4 nanowires. As-prepared samples heated at 1300 degrees C for different reaction times ( 1, 5, 10, and 30 h) were characterized by X- ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy- dispersive X- ray spectroscopy. The results showed that all the samples mainly consisted of nanowires, while their crystalline phases changed with the heating time. Nitrogen-doped silicon oxide nanowires were first produced via the vapor-liquid-solid process and then underwent a stepwise surface nitrogenization to silicon nitride. The suggested mechanism can easily explain the existence of nanotubes in the Si3N4 nanowires.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrated the feasibility of a high-performance membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA), with low electrocatalyst loading on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown directly on carbon cloth as an anode. The direct growth of CNTs was synthesized by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using CH4/H-2/N-2 as precursors. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance measurements with 1 mM Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-)redox reaction reveal a fast electron transport and a low resistance of charge transfer on the direct growth of CNT. The electrocatalysts, platinum and ruthenium, were coated on CNTs by sputtering to form Pt-Ru/CNTs-CC with carbon cloth for CC. Pt-Ru electrocatalysts are uniformly dispersed on the CNT, as indicated by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), because the nitrogen doped in the CNT acts as active sites for capturing electrocatalysts. The MEA, the sandwiched structure which comprises 0.4 mg cm(-2) Pt-Ru/CNTs-CC as the anode, 3.0 mg cm(-2) Pt black as the cathode and Nation 117 membrane at the center, performs very well in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) test. The micro- structural MEA analysis shows that the thin electrocatalyst layer is uniform, with good interfacial continuity between membrane and the gas diffusion layer. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Rotating ring disk measurements are shown to be an alternative technique to split the total current density into partial currents that could be associated with the respective reaction pathways. Experimental comparisons of the NCNT and Pt/C catalysts revealed that the ORR kinetics on these materials proceeds similarly throughout two and four electron pathways.

The symmetry-adapted scheme allows reducing the matrix eigenvalue problem for the electrons to diagonalization of 8���������������8 matrices for any nanotube type. Due to this simplification, the electronic band structure of nanotubes with a very large number of atoms in the unit cell can be calculated. Using this model, the structure of 187 small- and moderate-radius nanotubes is optimized. It is found that the deviations of the optimized structure from the non-optimized one are large for tube radii smaller than 5 ���������������. The band structure and the dielectric function of 101 small- and moderate-radius nanotubes are calculated. The optical transition energies for these nanotubes are derived from the dielectric function and plotted versus tube radius. It is shown that the structural optimization introduces small changes to the transition energies obtained within the non-orthogonal tight-binding model. The transition energies for the optimized structure within this model agree well with the available ab initio data for a few nanotube types. On the other hand, the results for the former deviate widely from those used for nanotube characterization in ������������-band tight-binding model especially for small-radius tubes. The derived transition energies can be used for the assignment of nanotube absorption spectra and for the selection of nanotube types for which the Raman scattering is resonant.},

  abstract = {The reactions of methyl radicals with large (up to C96H24) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are studied by density functional calculations to shed light on the experimentally observed deposition of carbon on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which occurs when hot HOPG (decorated by nanometre-sized defects) is exposed to methyl radicals. The equilibrium structures of the reaction products, together with transition structures for PAHs up to the size of phenanthroperylene, are determined using the density functionals B3LYP, TPSSh, BP86 and TPSS. The structures are analysed by computing the pi orbital axis vector (POAV) and the altitude of the reactive carbon above the molecular plane of the PAH. The strongest C-CH3 bonds are found at the edges of the PAHs, where the s character of the C orbital involved in the bond is roughly 25\% (sp(3) hybrid orbital). Carbon atoms inside the PAH form bonds with the methyl radical through atomic orbitals with about 16\% s character in the POAV analysis. These bonds are much weaker than those at the edges of the PAH, while the reactive carbon has moved about 40 pm above the molecular plane. At the edges, the PAH carbon atoms do not leave the molecular plane to this extent. The computed barrier heights and geometrical parameters of the transition structures are in agreement with Hammond's postulate, and the relative energies of all of the equilibrium structures can be rationalized by Huckel molecular orbital (HMO) theory.},

CNx nanotubes prepared by catalyzed pyrolysis of melamine exhibit a highly compartmentalized morphology with a remarkable periodicity structure along the nanotube axis. Spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (spectrum-imaging mode) indicates that the nanotubes are made of carbon and nitrogen, inhomogeneously distributed with an enrichment of carbon on the external surfaces. The evolution of the C-K-edge shape across the nanotube reveals a transition from a graphitic stacking on the outside to a disorganized-mixed type in the core of the nanotube. For the N-K edge, the situation is more complex. The fine structure of the N-K edge differs depending on the used catalyst, which indicates differences in the bonding configuration. When Ni is used as a catalyst, N replaces C in the graphitic structure whereas C-N pyridinic-like bonds are formed when the catalyst is Fe. The compartmentalized periodic morphology is the result of a systematic catalytic particle movement from the root of the nanotube to the tip. This displacement is defined by the nature of the catalytic particle, diffusion, and supersaturation (C/N) in the liquid particle and precipitation process. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Verification of this assignment protocol is based upon statistical analysis of hundreds of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images as well as comparison with Raman measurements on the same SWNT samples.

Microcrystals of refractory carbides (i.e. NbC, TaC, MoC), contained in nanotubes and polyhedral particles, produced by arcing electrodes of graphite/metal mixtures, were analysed by high hesolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray powder diffraction. Encapsulation of MoC was found to give rise to an unusual stable form, namely face-centered-cubic MoC. SQUID measurements indicate that the encapsulated carbides exhibit superconducting transitions at about 10-12 K, thus they differ from carbon nanotubes/nanoparticles which do not superconduct. Four-probe and microwave (contactless) conductivity measurements indicate that most of the analysed samples behave as semiconductors. However, metallic transport was observed in specimens containing single conglomerated carbon nanotube bundles and boron-doped carbon nanotubes. Novel metallic beta-Sn nanowires were produced by electrolysis of graphite electrodes immersed in molten LiCl/SnCl2 mixtures. Prolonged electron irradiation of these nanowires leads to axial growth and to dynamic transformations. These observations suggest ways in which materials may be modified by microencapsulation and irradiation.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly pyrolytic routes to large arrays ({\textless} 2.5 cm(2)) of aligned CNx nanotubes (15-80 nm OD and {\textless} 100 mum in length) are presented. The method involves the thermolysis of ferrocene/melamine mixtures (5 : 95) at 900-1000degreesC in the presence of Ar. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals that the N content varies from 2\%-10\%, and can be bonded to C in two different fashions (double-bonded and triple-bonded nitrogen). The electronic densities of states (DOS) of these CNx nanotubes, using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), are presented. The doped nanotubes exhibit strong features in the conduction band close to the Fermi level (0.18 eV). Using tight-binding and ab initio calculations, we confirm that pyridine-like (double-bonded) N is responsible for introducing donor states close to the Fermi Level. These electron-rich structures are the first example of n-type nanotubes. Finally, it will be shown that moderate electron irradiation at 700-800 degreesC is capable of coalescing single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs). The process has also been studied using tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD). Vacancies induce the coalescence via a zipper-like mechanism, which has also been observed experimentally. These vacancies trigger the organization of atoms on the tube lattices within adjacent tubes. These results pave the way to the fabrication of nanotube heterojunctions, robust composites, contacts, nanocircuits and strong 3D composites using N-doped tubes as well as SWNTs.},

One way for achieving this control is by carrying out doping processes through which atoms and molecules interact (covalently or noncovalently) with the nanotube surfaces. The aim of this chapter is to emphasize the importance of different types of doping in carbon nanotubes (single-, double- and multiwall). There are three main categories of doping: exohedral, endohedral and inplane doping. We will review the most efficient ways to dope carbon nanotubes and discuss the effects on the electronic, vibrational, chemical, magnetic and mechanical properties. In addition, we will discuss the different ways of characterizing these doped nanotubes using spectroscopic techniques, such as resonant Raman, X-ray photoelectron, electron energy loss spectroscopy and others. It will be demonstrated that doped carbon nanotubes could be used in the fabrication of nanodevices (e.g., sensors, protein immobilizers, field emission sources, efficient composite fillers, etc.). We will also present results related to the importance of inplane-doped nanotubes for attaching various metal clusters and polymers covalently using wet chemical routes.},

However, at the nanoscale, defects could be extremely useful since they could be exploited to generate novel, innovative and useful materials and devices. Graphene and graphene nanoribbons are no exception. This review therefore tries to categorize defects, emphasize their importance, introduce the common routes to study and identify them and to propose new ways to construct novel devices based on ���defective��� graphene-like materials. In particular, we will discuss defects in graphene-like systems including (a) structural (sp 2 -like) defects, (b) topological (sp 2 -like) defects, (c) doping or functionalization (sp 2 - and sp 3 -like) defects and (d) vacancies/edge type defects (non-sp 2 -like). It will be demonstrated that defects play a key role in graphene physicochemical properties and could even be critical to generate biocompatible materials. There are numerous challenges in this emerging field, and we intend to provide a stimulating account which could trigger new science and technological developments based on defective graphene-like materials that could be introduced into other atomic layered materials, such as BN, MoS 2 and WS 2 , not discussed in this review.},

A time range of at most 0.4 ns is covered in the molecular dynamics simulations. Different degrees of adatom coverage are considered. Nitrogen and carbon atoms express different dynamics. Adsorbed monomers and large fragments are rather immobile whereas dimers and trimers move fast. Nitrogen-containing fragments are less strongly bound to the iron cluster and are therefore more mobile than carbon-only fragments with equal amount of atoms. On the iron nanoparticle surface, five-membered rings are formed first and then six-membered rings. The present simulations provide insight into the atomistic mechanisms involved in the nanocatalyzed synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. The tendency of nitrogen atoms as parts of carbon fragments to repel the iron surface is confirmed by performing short molecular dynamics simulations at the density-functional theory level.},

The former ones were grown directly on prepatterned cobalt-coated silicon substrate, while the latter ones were grown on Si-tip arrays. Each array contains 50 x 50 emitting cells and each individual cell is 3 mu m square. A maximum effective emission current density of about 17 A/cm(2) (at a macroscopic field of 17.5 V/mu m) has been demonstrated, while a macroscopic emission current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with operating fields around 10 V/mu m can be routinely achieved from an an ay of CNT emitters. In contrast, operating fields above 20 V/mu m were needed to draw a comparable emission current density from all of the diamond-clad Si tips arrays. Emission stability test performed at 40 mA/cm(2) for CNT arrays also showed little sign of degradation. Due to the high efficiency of electron emission, simple sample process, and large area growth capability, field emitter arrays based on CNT are attractive for flat panel display applications.

By controlling the flow-rate of ammonia during the chemical vapor deposition, the nitrogen concentration of 0.6 at.\% to 3.2 at.\% was obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that three different structures of the nitrogen atoms are involved in the nitrogen-doped MWCNTs, among which a graphite-like structure is dominant in these MWCNTs. Thermal gravimetric analyses show that the purity of the as-prepared MWCNTs is over 95\%. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses indicate that the MWCNTs have high graphitization degree. Our experimental results showed that the CoxMg1-xMoO4 catalyst is ideal for the synthesis of high-quality nitrogen-doped MWCNTs because of its high catalytic activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We have determined electron inelastic mean free paths (IMFPs) in C (graphite), Si, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ga, Mo, Ag, Ta, W, Pt and Au by elastic-peak electron spectroscopy (EPES) using Ni as a reference material for electron energies between 50 and 5000 eV. These IMFPs could be fitted by the simple Bethe equation for inelastic electron scattering in matter for energies from 100 to 5000 eV. The average root-mean-square (RMS) deviation in these fits was 9\%. The IMFPs for Si, Cr, Fe, Cu, Ag, Ta, W, Pt and Au were in excellent agreement with the corresponding values calculated from optical data for energies between 100 and 5000 eV. While the RMS differences for graphite and Mo in these comparisons were large (27 and 17\%, respectively), the average RMS difference for the other 11 elements was 11\%. Similar comparisons were made between our IMFPs and values obtained from the TPP-2M predictive equation for energies between 100 and 5000 eV, and the average RMS difference for the 13 solids was 10.7\%; in these comparisons, the RMS differences for Ta and W were relatively large (26\% for each). A correction for surface-electronic excitations was calculated from a formula of Werner et al.; except for Si and Ga, the average correction was 5\% for energies between 150 and 5000 eV. The satisfactory consistency between the IMFPs from our EPES experiments and the corresponding IMFPs computed from optical data indicates that the uncertainty of these IMFPs is about 11\% for electron energies between 100 and 5000 eV. Similar comparisons with IMFPs from the EPES experiments of Werner et al. showed a consistency of 8\% for energies between 200 and 5000 eV. Copyright ������ 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWCNTs) were synthesized using a floating catalyst aerosol chemical vapor deposition method, with carbon monoxide as the carbon source, ammonia as the nitrogen source, and iron particles derived from evaporated iron as the catalyst. The material was deposited on various substrates as grown directly from the gas phase as films and subsequently characterized by Raman and optical absorption spectroscopies, sheet resistance measurements, electron microscopy, energy-loss spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sheet resistance measurements revealed that the doped films had unexpectedly high resistances. This stands in contrast to the case of N-MWCNT films, where decreased resistance has been reported with N-doping. To understand this effect, we developed a resistor network model, which allowed us to disentangle the contribution of bundle���������������������bundle contacts when combined with data on undoped films. Assuming doping does not significantly change the contacts, the increased resistances of the doped films are likely due to enhanced carrier scattering by defect sites in the nanotubes. This work represents the first experimental report on macroscopic N-SWCNT thin films.},

A possible dissociation path for NH3 to atomic nitrogen and hydrogen was identified, with a reaction barrier consistent with an experimentally determined value we measured by tandem infrared and mass spectrometry.

  abstract = {By combining ab initio simulations with state-of-the-art electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we study the mechanism of electron beam damage in nitrogen-doped graphene and carbon nanotubes. Our results show that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms results in noticeable knock-on damage in these structures already at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV, at which essentially no damage is created in pristine structures at corresponding doses. Contrary to an early estimate predicting rapid destruction via sputtering of the nitrogen atoms, in the case of substitutional doping, damage is initiated by displacement of carbon atoms neighboring the nitrogen dopant, leading to the conversion of substitutional dopant sites into pyridinic ones. Although such events are relatively rare at 80 kV, they become significant at higher voltages typically used in electron energy loss spectroscopy studies. Correspondingly, we measured an energy loss spectrum time series at 100 kV that provides direct evidence for such conversions in nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes, in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction. Besides providing an improved understanding of the irradiation stability of these structures, we show that structural changes cannot be neglected in their characterization employing high-energy electrons.},

  abstract = {The adsorptions of a glycine molecule as well as dehydrogenated radicals on the side walls of both intrinsic and boron-doped (B-doped) single-walled (8,0) carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were investigated by a density functional theory. A glycine molecule tends to physically adsorb on intrinsic SWCNTs yet chemically adsorb on B-doped SWCNTs as a result of a somewhat chemical bond between the electron-rich nitrogen atom of the glycine molecule and the electron-scarce boron atom of the doped SWCNT. Opposite to the previous report (J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6048-6050), it is found in the present study that both the N-centered and C-centered glycine radicals can form quite stable complexes with intrinsic as well as B-doped (8,0) SWCNTs. When the B-doped SWCNT interacts with glycine radicals, although there is a competition between B and the neighbor C in the nanotube axis direction, glycine radicals preferentially bind to the C site. The encapsulations of a glycine molecule into SWCNTs with various diameters are also discussed. We find that the encapsulation process is endothermic for (8,0) and (9,0) SWCNTs, while it is exothermic for (10,0) SWCNTs, indicating that the critical diameter of the zigzag SWCNT for the encapsulation is 7.83 angstrom, the diameter of (10,0).},

  abstract = {Amorphous carbon thin films doped with nitrogen (a-C:N) have been synthesized by means of shielded are ion plating (SAIP). Their electron field emission properties, that is, threshold field strengths for electron emission and maximum emission current densities, were evaluated and compared with those of pure amorphous carbon (a-C) films prepared by the same SAIP apparatus. Among all of the fabricated a-C:N films, the a-C:N films with a N concentration of 23 \%, which prepared using N-2 arc plasm at a pressure of 1 Pa with applying a sample bias voltage of -100 V, showed the lowest threshold filed of 13.4 V/mum and the highest emission current density of 1.87 muA/cm(2) at a field of 20 V/mum. These field emission properties of the a-C:N film were much better than those of the a-C films. The best results obtained on the a-C film in this study were the lowest threshold filed of 15.5 V/mum and the highest emission current density of 0.052 muA/cm(2) at a field of 20 V/mum. Nitrogen doping to a-C was found to be effective for lowering threshold voltage for field-emission and for increasing emission current density. The electron field emission characteristics of the a-C:N films depended not only on N concentration but also on chemical bonding state of nitrogen in the a-C:N films. The presence of the beta -C3N4-like phase, which contributes to improve wear resistance of a-C:N as well, distinguished by the N1s XPS peak at 400.5 eV is proved to be crucial in order to enhance field emission properties of a-C:N.},

X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the Pb was deposited on carbon powder as a mixture of PbO and PbO2 molecular structures. The catalysts Pt-(RuO2-PbOx) and Pt-(RuO2-IrO2) exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the ethanol oxidation as compared to Pt/C commercial powder. Quasi-steady-state polarization curves showed that the composites Pt-(RuO2-PbOx)/C and Pt-(RuO2-IrO2)/C started the oxidation process in very low potentials (155 and 178 mV, respectively). So, the addition of metallic oxides by the sol-gel route to Pt is presented as a very interesting way to prepare materials with high catalytic activity for direct ethanol fuel cell systems. Current-time studies also showed the good performance of the Pt-(RuO2-PbOx) catalyst due to smaller poisoning of the material as the process advances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  volume = {53},
  issn = {0013-4686},
  abstract = {Reduction of dioxygen catalyzed by laccase was studied at carbon electrodes without any added mediators. On bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) the catalytic reduction did not take place. However, when the same substrate was decorated with carbon nanotubes or carbon microcrystals the dioxygen reduction started at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is close to the formal potential of the laccase used. Four different matrices: lecithin, hydrophobin, Nafion and lipid liquid-crystalline cubic phase were employed for hosting fungal laccase from Cerrena unicolor. The carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles present on the electrode provided electrical connectivity between the electrode and the enzyme active sites. Direct electrochemistry of the enzyme itself was observed in deoxygenated solutions and its catalytic activity towards dioxygen reduction was demonstrated. The stabilities of the hosted enzymes, the reduction potentials and ratios of catalytic to background currents were compared. The boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes prepolarized to high anodic potentials exhibited behavior similar to that of nanotube covered GCE pointing to the formation of nanostructures during the anodic pretreatment. BDD is a promising substrate in terms of potential of dioxygen reduction, however the catalytic current densities are not large enough for practical applications, therefore as shown in this paper, it should be additionally decorated with carbon particles being in direct contact with the electrode surface.

In the present study, the effect of functionalising/doping the CNTs on their electron-extraction efficiency has been investigated, using ab-initio density-functional theory. Pristine, fluorine-doped, and potassium-doped (8,8) CNTs have been modelled both in isolation and lying prone on the (001)-(2 x 1): H surface of diamond. The total energies of the relaxed systems suggest that the CNTs are positively bound to the diamond substrate, while the structures and charge densities indicate that only physisorption has occurred. The electronic band structures are indicative of an enhanced electron transfer following fluorination of the CNT, while potassium doping of the CNT has destroyed the transfer-doping effect.

The use of BDD resulted in a much higher stability of the catalyst under severe anodic conditions. Steady-state and long-time methanol oxidation polarization measurements, performed in the “floating electrode” configuration in acidic media, showed that platinum on BDD powder was less sensitive to deactivation, presumably due to CO poisoning, than was platinum on graphite powder.

The structural properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared absorption (FTIR), electron spin resonance (ESR), field emission scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HR-TEM). The results indicate that the YBO3 nanotubes and nanowires were hexangular in phase and single crystals or polycrystalline in structure. Some surface dangling bonds caused by transition metal ions lead to a change of the coordination number of boron from +3 to +4. The photolummescent properties of the YBO3: Eu3+ nanowires and nanotubes were also characterized. It was observed that the charge-transfer excitation bands of Eu3+ in the nanowires and nanotubes blueshifted in contrast to those in bulk, because of the variation of coordination environments.},

Films were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy. a-C:H films on silicon are observed to have very smooth morphology whereas the films become nanoparticulate one at higher nitrogen content in the film. Particulate formation is observed to be more pronounced on ITO substrate when compared with the simultaneously deposited films on silicon. Compositional study by EDAX indicates that nitrogen concentration is much larger (considering carbon concentration) in the films on ITO as compared to those on silicon. These observations clearly indicate that nitrogen induces nanoparticulate formation in a-C:H-N films by providing more curvature to carbon lattice, as nitrogen prefers non-planer configuration.

The magnetization can be attributed to the 3p unpaired electron of silicon. Compared to other theoretical models of light-element or metal-free magnetic materials, the silicon-doped (5,5) BN nanotubes are more experimentally accessible and can be potentially useful.},

The galvanostatic measurement (40 mAg(-1), 2 similar to 4 V vs. Li/Li+) in a three-electrode system showed 15 Fg(-1) of gravimetric capacitance and a good rate of this property. Due to the tips opening by thermal oxidation, the specific surface area and the capacitance increased. In contrast, heat-treatment at 3000 degrees C decreased the surface area and the capacitance of the MWCNT due to defect recovery. A small amount ({\textless} 1 at. \%) of boron was doped to the MWCNT by heat-treatment at 2200 degrees C or 2300 degrees C with a B-contained graphite crucible. The B-doping can improve the specific capacitance per surface area for the MWCNTs while maintaining the tube morphology. This effect of B-doping on the capacitance can be explained by modification of the space charge layer in carbon.},

  abstract = {Heat treating nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes containing up to six different types of nitrogen functionalities transforms particular nitrogen functionalities into other types which are more catalytically active toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). In the first stage, the unstable pyrrolic functionalities transform into pyridinic functionalities followed by an immediate transition into quaternary center and valley nitrogen functionalities. By measuring the electrocatalytic oxidation reduction current for the different samples, we achieve information on the catalytic activity connected to each type of nitrogen functionality. Through this, we conclude that quaternary nitrogen valley sites, N-Qvalley, are the most active sites for ORR in N-CNTs. The number of electrons transferred in the ORR is determined from ring disk electrode and rotating ring disk electrode measurements. Our measurements indicate that the ORR processes proceed by a direct four-electron pathway for the N-Qvalley and the pyridinic sites while it proceeds by an indirect two-electron pathway via hydrogen peroxide at the N-Qcenter sites. Our study gives both insights on the mechanism of ORR on different nitrogen functionalities in nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures and it proposes how to treat samples to maximize the catalytic efficiency of such samples.},

The goal is to achieve direct thermal to electric energy conversion with {\textgreater} 20\% efficiency and {\textgreater} 1W/cm(2) power density at a hot side temperature of 300-650C. `Thermionic emission in both vacuum and solid-state devices is investigated. In the case of solid-state devices, hot electron filtering using heterostructure barriers is used to increase the thermoelectric power factor. In order to study electron transport above the barriers and lateral momentum conservation in thermionic emission process, the current-voltage characteristic of ballistic transistor structures is investigated. Embedded ErAs nanoparticles and metal/semiconductor multilayers are used to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Cross-plane thermoelectric properties and the effective ZT of the thin film are analyzed using the transient Harman technique. Integrated circuit fabrication techniques are used to transfer the n- and p-type thin films on AIN substrates and make power generation modules with hundreds of thin film elements. For vacuum devices, nitrogen-doped diamond and carbon nanotubes are studied for emitters. Sb-doped highly oriented diamond and low electron affinity AlGaN are investigated for collectors. Work functions below 1.6eV and vacuum thermionic power generation at temperatures below 700C have been demonstrated.},

In both samples, impurity concentrations, principally oxygen and nitrogen, were found to be low relative to boron dopant levels, For low boron contents, typically around 5-10 at.\%, the sample consisted of union-like spherical particles approximately 10 nm in diameter which exhibited a non-homogeneous distribution of boron, concentrated at a level of 5-6 at.\% in the centre. For this sample, studies of the B-K- and C-K-ELNES (electron energy loss near-edge structure) together with associated modelling of the unoccupied density of electronic states, indicate a substitution of boron atoms on threefold coordinated spl-sites within the graphite network. For higher boron doping levels, typically 25 at.\%, the sample consisted of homogeneous thin films. In this case, the change in shape of the B-K-ELNES indicates that boron has higher coordinations than planar trigonal together with possibly some residual sp(2) sites. This study unambiguously demonstrates the presence of boron substitution solely within an sp(2)-bonded graphite network in the case of low boron contents and, when combined with other studies, gives an indication of the solubility limit for boron in graphite for the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process.

  abstract = {The electronic and chemical properties of graphene can be modulated by chemical doping foreign atoms and functional moieties. The general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) performed in gas phases, requires transitional metal catalysts which could contaminate the resultant products and thus affect their properties. In this paper, we propose a facile, catalyst-free thermal annealing approach for large-scale synthesis of NG using low-cost industrial material melamine as the nitrogen source. This approach can completely avoid the contamination of transition metal catalysts, and thus the intrinsic catalytic performance of pure NGs can be investigated. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis of the resultant products shows that the atomic percentage of nitrogen in doped graphene samples can be adjusted up to 10.1\%. Such a high doping level has not been reported previously. High-resolution N1s spectra reveal that the as-made NG mainly contains pyridine-like nitrogen atoms. Electrochemical characterizations clearly demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activity of NG toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes, which is independent of nitrogen doping level. The present catalyst-free approach opens up the possibility for the synthesis of NG in gram-scale for electronic devices and cathodic materials for fuel cells and biosensors.},

The directly sythesized NH3 together with the NH3 obtained from the hydrolysis of HCN, nitriles and urea could have been a major source of ammonia in the atmosphere and oceans of the primitive earth. These results show that prebiotic syntheses from HCN and H2CO to give products such as purines and sugars and some amino acids could have occurred in primitive atmospheres containing CO and CO2 provided the H2/CO and H2/CO2 ratios were greater than about 1.0. Methane containing atmospheres give comparable quantities of HCN and H2CO, and are superior in the synthesis of amino acids.},

  abstract = {Robust methods to tune the unique electronic properties of graphene by chemical modification are in great demand due to the potential of the two dimensional material to impact a range of device applications. Here we show that carbon and nitrogen core-level resonant X-ray spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of chemical bonding and electronic structure of chemical dopants introduced in single-sheet graphene films. In conjunction with density functional theory based calculations, we are able to obtain a detailed picture of bond types and electronic structure in graphene doped with nitrogen at the sub-percent level. We show that different N-bond types, including graphitic, pyridinic, and nitrilic, can exist in a single, dilutely N-doped graphene sheet. We show that these various bond types have profoundly different effects on the carrier concentration, indicating that control over the dopant bond type is a crucial requirement in advancing graphene electronics.},

They have a single-crystalline zinc blende structure with [111] growth direction. The morphology and structure were controlled by reactant gas, growth time, flow rate, and growth temperature. The size, morphology and properties of the nanostructures were examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), electron diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, powder x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy using a 514.5 nm argon ion laser. The photoluminescence was carried out using the 458 nm line of an argon ion laser as the excitation source. The Gal? nanowires are straight, cylindrical, and smooth in surface, with mean diameter of 40 nm and length up to 300 mm. The nitrogen-doped nanobelts and nanowires were synthesized by ammonia ambient gas. EELS data reveals that the nitrogen doping occurs mainly in the surface region. The PL spectrum shows the typical isoelectronic bound exciton peaks in the range of 2.11similar to2.25 eV, suggesting a concentration of (10(18) cm(-3) nitrogen atoms. We also synthesized two types of GaP nanocables; GaP nanowire sheathed with the amorphous silicon oxide layers and with the graphite layers. The core-shell diameter is under 30 nm and the outerlayer can be removed by acid treatment to produce the 10 nm diameter GaP nanowires. The GaP encapsulated with BCN nanotubes were synthesized under the ammonia flow using the ball-milled carbon-containing boron oxide powders. The number of BCN layers is typically 10similar to20.},

The electrochemical results indicate that with PtRu/GNF and PtRu/FWCNT higher current densities are obtained and oxidation intermediates deactivate the surface less compared to the same catalyst on Vulcan support. Conversely, PtRu/Vulcan provided the highest open circuit voltage OCV and current densities in DMFC experiments due to a well-optimized electrode layer structure. Because stability is a key requirement for fuel cell commercialization, 6-day-long fuel cell stability tests were carried out, showing that PtRu/Vulcan degraded significantly. This was due to the collapse of the secondary structure of the electrode layer revealed by post characterization of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with SEM and TEM. PtRu/GNF exhibited slightly poorer initial performance but better stability because the structure of the anode layer was maintained. PtRu/FWCNT showed the worst initial performance and long-term stability. The good stability of non-optimized PtRu/GNF MEAs shows the potential of these novel nanocarbon supported catalysts as stable fuel cell components after proper MEA optimization.},

The structural and electronic properties of nitrogen-doped MWNTs were determined by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and thermopower measurements. The individual nitrogen-doped nanotube exhibits a bamboo-like structure and comprises 6-16 tube walls, as evidenced by HRTEM studies. The EELS measurements yielded an average nitrogen content of similar to5 at\% in the doped tubes.

Interaction with the substrate or with other tubes does not alter the scanning tunneling microscopy patterns (STM) observed for isolated tubes. A finite-length nanotube shows standing-wave patterns that can be completely characterized by a set of four different three-dimensional shapes. These patterns are understood in terms of a simple Is-electron tight-binding (TB) model. STM-topographic images of topological defects ani (pentagon/heptagon pair) and tube caps have also been studied. In both cases the image obtained depends on the sign of the applied voltage and can be described in terms of the previous catalog of STM images (interference between electronic waves scattered by the defect). We have also computed the electronic density of states for isolated tubes with different chiralities and radii, confirming a correlation between the peak structure in the DOS and nanotube diameter. However, the metallic plateau in the DOS also depends on the nanotube chirality. Furthermore the conduction an valence band structures are not fully symmetrical to one another. This anisotropy shows up in the DOS and indicates the limitations of the pi-TB model in describing spectroscopic data. In contrast to STM images, here the interaction with the substrate does modify the energy levels of the nanotube. We observe opening of small pseudogaps around the Fermi level and broadening of the sharp van Hove singularities of the isolated single-walled nanotubes that can be used to extract useful information about the tube structure and bonding. The combination of STM and spectroscopic studies provides a new way to address the electronic and structural properties of carbon and composite nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Via the example of a (5, 5) boron-nitrogen armchair nanotube, the influence of isoelectronic substitutional impurities on the electronic structure of BN nanotubes has been investigated with the use of linear augmented cylindrical waves. The treatment is based on the local density approximation and the muffin-tin approximation for the electron potential. In this method, the electronic spectrum of a system is governed by the free motion of electrons in the interatomic space between cylindrical barriers and the electron scattering on atomic centers. It has been found that the substitution of one atom of N by P leads to the splitting of all twofold degenerate bands by 0.2 eV on average, a decrease in the energy gap from 3.5 to 2.8 eV, the separation of the s(P) band from the high-energy region of the s(B, N) band, as well as to the formation of the impurity pi(P) and pi*(P) bands, which form the valence-band top and conduction-band bottom in the doped system. The influence of an As atom on the electronic structure of (5, 5) BN nanotubes is qualitatively similar to the case of phosphorus, but the energy gap is smaller by 0.5 eV. The optical gap in the nanotubes is closed due to the effect of the Sb atom impurity. A substitution of one B atom by an Al atom results in the strong perturbation of the band structure and the energy gap in this case is only 1.6 eV in contrast to the weak indium-induced perturbation of the band structure of the BN nanotube. In the latter case, the energy gap is 2.9 eV. The above effects can be detected by the optical and photoelectron spectroscopy methods, as well as by measuring the electrical properties of the nanotubes. They can be used to create electronic devices based on boron-nitrogen nanotubes.},

The technique includes a hydrothermal/ultrasonic treatment of the material in conjunction with other subsequent treatments, including the extraction of polyaromatic compounds, dissolution of metal particles, bundle exfoliation, and uniform dispersion. This method avoids harsh oxidation protocols that burn (via thermal treatments) or functionalize (by introducing chemical groups) the nanotubes. We show a careful analysis of each purification step and demonstrate that the technique is extremely efficient when characterizing the materials using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX), scanning tuneling electron microscopy (STEM), x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRFTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).},

Nanophase formation and dispersion problems associated with the use of carbon nanotubes in polymer devices were addressed through the generation of functional groups and electrostatic attaching of the polyelectrolyte poly(dimethyldiallylamine) chloride (PDDA) in both MWNTs and CNx-MWNT systems. The resultant nanophase was highly dispersed allowing for excellent bulk heterojunction formation.

Raman scattering is thus very powerful in detecting the hexagonal phase in mixed thin boron nitride films. In cubic BN the constant Raman sucseptibility in the visible and the UV is due to its indirect band gap. For hexagonal BN a Raman enhancement is found at 5.4 eV. It is well explained by the energy dependence of the dielectric function of hexagonal BN. The second-order spectrum of cubic boron nitride is in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations of the phonon density of states. In hexagonal BN the overbending of the LO phonon is approximate to 100 cm(-1), five times larger than in graphite.},

In combination with electron energy loss spectroscopy, employed to identify individual impurity atoms, it was shown that nanoscale holes were etched into graphene, initiated at sites where single atoms of all the metal species except for gold come into close contact with the graphene. The e-beam scanning process is instrumental in promoting metal atoms from clusters formed during the original metal deposition process onto the clean graphene surface, where they initiate the hole-forming process. Our observations are discussed in the light of calculations in the literature, predicting a much lowered vacancy formation in graphene when metal ad-atoms are present. The requirement and importance of oxygen atoms in this process, although not predicted by such previous calculations, is also discussed, following our observations of hole formation in pristine graphene in the presence of Si-impurity atoms, supported by new calculations which predict a dramatic decrease of the vacancy formation energy, when SiOx molecules are present.},

The resultant N-graphene was demonstrated to act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction via a four-electron pathway in alkaline fuel cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of graphene and its derivatives as metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction. The important role of N-doping to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be applied to various carbon materials for the development of other metal-free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell applications, even new catalytic materials for applications beyond fuel cells.},

  abstract = {The properties of a carbon nanotube are dependent on its atomic structure. The atomic structure of a carbon nanotube can be defined by specifying its chiral indices, (u, v), that specify its perimeter vector (chiral vector), with which the diameter and helicity are also determined. The fine electron beam available in a modern transmission electron microscope (TEM) offers a unique probe to reveal the atomic structure of individual nanotubes. This review covers two aspects related to the use of the electron probe in the TEM for the study of carbon nanotubes: (a) to understand the electron diffraction phenomena for interpretation of the electron diffraction patterns of carbon nanotubes and (b) to obtain the chiral indices, (u, v), of the carbon nanotubes from the electron diffraction patterns. For a nanotube of a given structure, the electron scattering amplitude from the carbon nanotube is first described analytically in closed form using the helical diffraction theory. From a known structure as given by the chiral indices (u, v), its electron diffraction pattern can be calculated and understood. The reverse problem, i.e. assignment of the chiral indices from an electron diffraction pattern of a carbon nanotube, is approached from the relationship between the electron scattering intensity distribution and the chiral indices (u, v). We show that electron diffraction patterns can provide an accurate and unambiguous assignment of the chiral indices of carbon nanotubes. The chiral indices (u, v) can be read indiscriminately with a high accuracy from the intensity distribution on the principal layer lines in an electron diffraction pattern. The symmetry properties of electron diffraction from carbon nanotubes and the electron diffraction from deformed carbon nanotubes are also discussed in detail. It is shown that 2mm symmetry is always preserved for single-walled carbon nanotubes, but it can break down for multiwalled carbon nanotubes under some special circumstances. Finally, determination of the handedness of carbon nanotubes using electron diffraction is reviewed and discussed with both theoretical analysis and experimental examples.},

  abstract = {The atomic structure of a carbon nanotube can be defined by the chiral indices, (n,m), that specify its perimeter vector (chiral vector), with which the diameter and helicity are also determined. The fine electron beam available in a modern Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) offers a unique and powerful probe to reveal the atomic structure of individual nanotubes. This article covers two aspects related to the use of the electron probe in the TEM for the study of carbon nanotubes: (i) to express the electron diffraction intensity distribution in the electron diffraction patterns of carbon nanotubes and (ii) to obtain the chiral indices (n,m) of carbon nanotubes from their electron diffraction patterns.

The reverse problem, i.e., assignment of the chiral indices (n,m) of a carbon nanotube from its electron diffraction pattern, is approached from the relationship between the electron diffraction intensity distribution and the chiral indices (n,m). The first method is to obtain indiscriminately the chiral indices (n,m) by reading directly the intensity distribution on the three principal layer lines, l(1), l(2), and l(3), which have intensities proportional to the square of the Bessel functions of orders m, n, and n + m: I-l1 proportional to vertical bar J(m) (pi dR)vertical bar(2), I-l2 proportional to vertical bar J(n) (pi dR)vertical bar(2), and I-l3 proportional to vertical bar J(n+m) (pi dR)vertical bar(2). The second method is to obtain and use the ratio of the indices n/m = (2D(1) - D-2)/ (2D(2) - D-1) in which D-1 and D-2 are the spacings of principal layer lines l(1) and l(2), respectively. Examples of using these methods are also illustrated in the determination of chiral indices of isolated individual single-walled carbon nanotubes, a bundle of single-walled carbon nanotubes, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes.},

  abstract = {The geometrical structures and field emission properties of pristine and N-doped capped (5,5) single-walled carbon nanotubes have been investigated using first-principles density-functional theory. The structures of N-doped carbon nanotubes are stable under field emission conditions. The calculated work function of N-doped carbon nanotube decreases drastically when compared with pristine carbon nanotube, which means the enhancement of field emission properties. The ionization potentials of N-doped carbon nanotubes are also reduced significantly. The authors analyze the field emission mechanism in terms of energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital, Mulliken charge population, and local density of states. Due to the doping of nitrogen atom, the local density of states at the Fermi level increases dramatically and donor states can be observed above the Fermi level. The authors' results suggest that the field emission properties of carbon nanotubes can be enhanced by the doping of nitrogen atom, which are consistent with the experimental results.

We find that covalent bonding arises between neighboring tubes in the bundles which results in the formation of complex structures. We show that a high concentration of dopant Li atoms in the bundles can be achieved by a combination of in-tube and interstitial doping. A high concentration of Li atoms involving only in-tube doping is energetically unfavorable due to repulsive interaction between the Li atoms. By contrast, increased doping with Cu atoms can produce a metallic wirelike structure along the longitudinal axis of each tube within the bundle.},

Nanoporous cellulose paper embedded with aligned carbon nanotube electrode and electrolyte constitutes the basic unit. The units are used to build various flexible supercapacitor, battery, hybrid, and dual-storage battery-in-supercapacitor devices. The thin freestanding nanocomposite paper devices offer complete mechanical flexibility during operation. The supercapacitors operate with electrolytes including aqueous solvents, room temperature ionic liquids, and bioelectrolytes and over record temperature ranges.

Voltammetric responses of the as-grown thin film electrode and surface-modified electrode to biomolecules such as L-ascorbic acid (L-AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid are examined. As-grown MWCNT electrodes exhibit selective voltammetric responses to the different biomolecules and faster electron-transfer kinetics compared to BDD. The selective response is due to the considerably lower anodic potential of L-AA on MWCNT (-48 mVvs Ag/AgCl compared to 575 mV on BDD). This electrocatalytic response can be replicated on a nonselective carbon nanofiber electrode by coating it with gold nanoparticles. BDD has no intrinsic selective response to L-AA, and surface modification by anodic polarization is necessary for resolving L-AA and DA.},

Kapton polymer films underwent carbonization (1000 C), followed by a mild oxidation process (CO2 at 900 C) for various periods of time, to obtain carbons of different pore structures. A specially designed cell was assembled in order to measure the conductivity of carbon electrodes at different potentials in solutions. When the carbon electrodes possessed molecular sieving properties, a remarkable dependence of their conductivity on their charging state was observed. Aqueous electrolyte solutions containing ions of different sizes were used in order to demonstrate this phenomenon. As the average pore size of the activated carbons was larger, their molecular sieving ability was lower, and the dependence of their conductivity on their charging state regained its classical form. This behavior is discussed herein.},

The lowest threshold field of 1.6 V/mum was observed from a MWNT-PS ratio of 11.1 wt \%. Emission current densities, together with the threshold fields for these films, show that the emission properties are comparable to those of vertically aligned CNTs as well as arrays of carbon fibers.

  doi = {10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00433},
  abstract = {In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the field of ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM). We begin by briefly discussing the emergence of methods for probing ultrafast structural dynamics and the information that can be obtained. Distinctions are drawn between the two main types of probes for femtosecond (fs) dynamics—fast electrons and X-ray photons—and emphasis is placed on how the nature of charged particles is exploited in ultrafast electron-based experiments. Following this, we describe the versatility enabled by the ease with which electron trajectories and velocities can be manipulated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) hardware configurations, and we emphasize how this is translated to the ability to measure scattering intensities in real, reciprocal, and energy space from presurveyed and selected nanoscale volumes. Owing to decades of ongoing research and development into TEM instrumentation combined with advances in specimen holder technology, comprehensive experiments can be conducted on a wide range of materials in various phases via in situ methods. Next, we describe the basic operating concepts of UEM, and we emphasize that its development has led to extension of several of the formidable capabilities of TEM into the fs domain, thus increasing the accessible temporal parameter space by several orders of magnitude. We then divide UEM studies into those conducted in real (imaging), reciprocal (diffraction), and energy (spectroscopy) space. We begin each of these sections by providing a brief description of the basic operating principles and the types of information that can be gathered followed by descriptions of how these approaches are applied in UEM, the type of specimen parameter space that can be probed, and an example of the types of dynamics that can be resolved. We conclude with an Outlook section, wherein we share our perspective on some future directions of the field pertaining to continued instrument development and application of the technique to solving seemingly intractable materials problems in addition to discovery-based research. Our goal with this Perspective is to bring the capabilities of UEM to the attention of materials scientists, chemists, physicists, and engineers in hopes that new avenues of research emerge and to make clear the large parameter space that is opened by extending TEM, and the ability to readily manipulate electron trajectories and energies, into the ultrafast domain.},

Using a large number of laser lines for excitation, the dispersion for the response from the inner tubes and from the outer tubes was found to be 85 and 99 cm(-1)/eV, respectively. the reduction of the dispersion for the inner tubes is a consequence of their high curvature and suggests a flattening of the phonon dispersion at the K point in the Brillouin zone. the frequency position for the G(') line of the inner tubes for a given laser energy was likewise strongly reduced as compared to values expected from tubes with standard diameter. This was again assigned to the strong curvature of the small-diameter inner tubes. Finally, the G(') line scattering cross sections for the outer tubes and for the inner tubes revealed resonances according to the transitions between the corresponding Van Hove singularities. the response from the inner tubes was particularly strong, in good agreement with the expected resonance enhancement resulting from their high curvature.},

A competition between a charge transfer to the SWCNT pods and to the C-60 peas is observed. At low intercalation levels, the charge transfer is predominantly to the SWCNT pods. the Fermi level shifts beyond the second van Hove singularity of the semiconducting tubes and below the first singularity of the metallic tubes, respectively. the doping of the valence band for FeCl3 intercalation (p doping) and of the conduction band for K intercalation (n type) is symmetric. At high levels of potassium intercalation, the Fermi level shifts beyond the third singularity of the semiconducting tubes and the C-60 molecules are charged as well finally yielding a C-60(6-) state that forms a one-dimensional metallic single-bonded C-60 polymer. For intermediate charging levels of the C-60 molecules, no line phases are observed in contrast to the fullerides. Rather, a quasicontinuous charge transfer is observed. This provides a unique procedure to establish a continuous charge transfer to C-60 by intercalation.},

  abstract = {Recently great advances have been made in demonstrating the viability of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to detect the presence of chemical gases such as NO2, NH3, and O-2, and they have led to the design of a new breed of sensor devices. Based on intrinsic CNTs, the devices are capable of detecting small concentration of molecules with high sensitivity under ambient conditions. However, these devices have a limitation that only molecules binding to a carbon nanotube can be detected. They are currently limited to NH3, NO2, and O-2, and a host of highly toxic gases (such as carbon monoxide), water molecules, and biomolecules cannot be detected using these intrinsic CNT devices. Recent efforts on externally functionalizing CNT surface and internal doping in CNT only result in temporary sensing capability due to the weak van der Waals interaction between CNT and doped materials. In this paper, we propose the concept of a new type of nanoscale sensor devices that can detect the presence of CO and water molecules. To overcome the reliability problem, these devices are developed by substitutional doping of impurity atoms (such as boron, nitrogen atoms) into intrinsic single-wall carbon nanotubes or by using composite BxCyNz nanotubes. Using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that these sensor devices can not only detect the presence of CO and water molecules, but also the sensitivity of these devices can be controlled by the doping level of impurity atoms in a nanotube.},

  abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the fate of nitrogen functional forms present in a lignite and its chars, chars derived from the model compounds acridine, carbazole and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Four different peaks have been found in the XPS patterns, corresponding to at least five different nitrogen functional forms, all being aromatic moieties. The XPS patterns of the synthetic chars were recorded for identification purposes. The distribution of nitrogen functional forms changes with increasing severity of the pyrolysis conditions. Under mild pyrolysis conditions, firstly unstable functionalities like pyridones, protonated pyridinic-N and N-oxides of pyridinic-N are converted to pyridinic-N and secondly pyrrolic-N is converted to pyridinic-N during condensation of the carbon matrix. During the condensation process, nitrogen atoms are incorporated in the graphene layers replacing carbon atoms. After severe pyrolysis all nitrogen is eventually present in 6-membered rings located at the edges of the graphene layers as pyridinic-N or in the interior as quaternary-N. Upon exposure to the ambient, N-oxides of pyridinic-N can be formed. During pyrolysis, differences in nitrogen distribution of the char precursors have diminished. It is presumed that the remaining small differences in the nitrogen distribution of the chars cannot significantly influence the formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion of the chars.},

The nitrogen-doped CNTs turned out to have n-type semiconductor characteristics. However, the detailed change in electronic behavior varied with the specific condition of the CNT. Specifically, the density of states (DOS) for (5, 5) nanotubes exhibited a shift of the electronic spectrum. On the other hand, for the case of (10, 10) nanotubes, the band gap was narrowed by nitrogen doping owing to the existence of nitrogen states near the conduction band minimum. Interestingly, the applied strain did not affect the electronic structure of the (10, 10) CNT. However, in the case of the 5\% nitrogen-doped (5, 5) CNT, the difference in the electronic structure was enhanced markedly with applied strain, unlike in the case of other armchair CNTs.},

Depending on the CVD temperature, the carbons exhibit microporosity, mesoporosity and significant levels of graphitisation. The layer structural ordering of the LDH is somewhat retained in the LDH/carbon composite obtained after CVD, but is lost after removal of the template to generate carbon. Both the LDH/carbon composites and carbons exhibit significant porosity. The composites have a surface area of up to 140 m(2) g(-1), while the surface area of carbons ranges between 200 and 1300 m(2) g(-1). Carbons obtained at CVD temperature of 700-800 degrees C have high surface area (800-1268 m(2) g(-1)) and high pore volume (1.2-1.5 cm(3) g(-1)). The morphology of the LDH template is retained in the carbon materials, which in general consist of an assembly of small flaky particles. The use of acetonitrile as carbon precursor generates N-doped carbon materials with a uniformly incorporated nitrogen content of 7-9 wt\%. The carbon materials exhibit significant hydrogen uptake; we obtained a hydrogen uptake capacity, at 20 bar and -196 degrees C, of up to 2.8 wt\%. The hydrogen uptake capacity depends on the surface area of the carbons and is therefore influenced by the choice of CVD temperature. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Atomic resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show highly crystalline single-layer parts of the sample changing to multi-layer domains where crystal boundaries are connected by chemical bonds. This suggests two different growth mechanisms. CVD and carbon segregation participate in the growth process and are responsible for the different structural formations found. Measurements of the electrical and mechanical properties on the centimeter scale provide evidence of a large scale structural continuity: (1) in the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, a non-zero value near 0\&\#xa0;K indicates the metallic character of electronic transport; (2) Young���������������������s modulus of a pristine polycarbonate film (1.37\&\#xa0;GPa) improves significantly when covered with FLG (1.85\&\#xa0;GPa). The latter indicates an extraordinary Young modulus value of the FLG-coating of TPa orders of magnitude. Raman and optical spectroscopy support the previous conclusions. The sample can be used as a flexible and transparent electrode and is suitable for use as special membranes to detect and study individual molecules in high-resolution TEM.},

  abstract = {Heteroatom doped carbon materials represent one of the most prominent families of materials that are used in energy related applications, such as fuel cells, batteries, hydrogen storage or supercapacitors. While doping carbons with nitrogen atoms has experienced great progress throughout the past decades and yielded promising material concepts, also other doping candidates have gained the researchers' interest in the last few years. Boron is already relatively widely studied, and as its electronic situation is contrary to the one of nitrogen, codoping carbons with both heteroatoms can probably create synergistic effects. Sulphur and phosphorus have just recently entered the world of carbon synthesis, but already the first studies published prove their potential, especially as electrocatalysts in the cathodic compartment of fuel cells. Due to their size and their electronegativity being lower than those of carbon, structural distortions and changes of the charge densities are induced in the carbon materials. This article is to give a state of the art update on the most recent developments concerning the advanced heteroatom doping of carbon that goes beyond nitrogen. Doped carbon materials and their applications in energy devices are discussed with respect to their boron-, sulphur- and phosphorus-doping.},

Analytical inspections of the obtained XRD profiles, such as the Diamond and the Hirsch methods, revealed that the doping of boron and nitrogen broadened the graphene size distribution; while it did not influence the stacking manner of graphenes. All doped carbons showed reductions in electrical conductivity by the factors of a quarter to a hundredth of the pristine carbons. Development of porosity was observed for the doped carbons. BIs and N1s XPS analyses revealed the presences of B-C bonds and B-N-C moieties in the BN-doped carbons.

Transport measurements across ion-irradiated graphene membranes subjected to in situ etching revealed that the created pores were cation-selective at short oxidation times, consistent with electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups terminating the pore edges. At longer oxidation times, the pores allowed transport of salt but prevented the transport of a larger organic molecule, indicative of steric size exclusion.

It is also found that boron and nitrogen zigzag and armchair doped graphene nanoribbons have a triplet ground state and could be ferromagnetic. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We have investigated theoretically the STM images and conductance signatures of defective carbon nanotubes. The defects considered are those that form on nanotubes under tension, both in the absence and presence of additional carbon atoms. The most prominent features observed in the STM images are a set of bright rings, whose positions correlate with the location of the pentagons within the defect. These features are useful, as they enable the ready identification of many of the defects. By contrast, most of the defects have only a relatively modest effect on the transport properties of the nanotubes. While there is a general decrease in the conductance of the nanotube due to scattering effects, there appears to be no unique feature that can be associated with any of the defects investigated. This unfortunately precludes the use of transport measurements as a means of defect identification. The STM images and conductances of nanotube heterojunctions, as well as tubes under different bias voltages, have also been explored.},

The ratio of the Raman D- and G- band intensities increase with the nitrogen concentration used during the CNT growth. Furthermore, the transmission electron microscope ( TEM) studies reveal that the CNTs are multi- walled ( MW), and that the diameters of the N- MWCNTs can be controlled by systematically varying the concentrations of the nitrogen source. The TEM analysis also revealed that when ferrocenylaniline and ferrocene/ aniline reactions are compared at similar Fe/ N ratios, higher N doping levels are achieved ( ca. 2 - 5 x) when ferrocenylaniline is the catalyst.

The behaviour of hydrogen molecules inside CNTs is analysed using mean-square displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions.

A range of carbonaceous structures, including carbon filaments with different lattice Structures and carbon nanospheres were obtained. The graphitic character of the carbon product has been evaluated by means of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and XRD analyses, surface area and porosity measurements for both catalyst and carbon product are provided and structural/morphological features illustrated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Carbon yield and morphology were strongly dependent on reaction temperature, the nature of the active metal and the use of a support. Carbon yield increased with increasing temperature (up to 1050 C) to give maximum values in the order Ni {\textless} Co {\textless} Ni/Y {\textless} Co/Y. The supported catalysts delivered significantly higher carbon yields (LIP to 35 g(carbon)/g(metal)) and initiated carbon growth at temperatures up to 300 degrees C lower than that observed for the bulk metals. Carbon generated over Ni/Y and Co/Y at 750 degrees C took the form of high aspect ratio nanofibres where the arrangement of graphene layers exhibited a periodic variation at higher reaction temperatures to ultimately result in a predominant production of nanospheres at 1150 degrees C, rather attributed to a thermal than a catalytic route. Based on TPO analyses, carbon grown from bulk and Supported Ni showed a higher degree of structural order compared with the Co promoted growth. An increase in reaction temperature served to enhance graphitic character. XRD analyses were in all the cases consistent with a graphitic product. Elemental (CHN) analysis of the carbon product has revealed a nitrogen content of up to 5 mol\%. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {There are few phenomena in condensed matter physics that are defined only by the fundamental constants and do not depend on material parameters. Examples are the resistivity quantum, h/e2 (h is Planck's constant and e the electron charge), that appears in a variety of transport experiments and the magnetic flux quantum, h/e, playing an important role in the physics of superconductivity. By and large, sophisticated facilities and special measurement conditions are required to observe any of these phenomena. We show that the opacity of suspended graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, a = e2/hc ������������������ 1/137 (where c is the speed of light), the parameter that describes coupling between light and relativistic electrons and that is traditionally associated with quantum electrodynamics rather than materials science. Despite being only one atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (pa = 2.3\%) fraction of incident white light, a consequence of graphene's unique electronic structure.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the electronic properties of defected boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for spin-up and spin-down electrons by using the first-principle density functional theory. Two types of defects have been considered, vacancy and substitution of carbon and oxygen by boron or nitrogen. The formation energy calculation shows that for both vacancies defected zigzag and armchair BNNTs, the probability of the nitrogen vacancy case is higher than that of the boron vacancy. Also in the carbon doping process of BNNTs, the substitution of boron by carbon is more possible with respect to nitrogen by carbon. In the oxygen doping substitution process, substitution of boron by oxygen is less favorable than nitrogen by oxygen. For the higher-probability cases the spin-up and spin-down band structures show different features. For the first and second cases, the spin-up band structure shows a n-type semiconductor, while the spin-down band structure illustrates a wide band gap semiconductor. But for the oxygen-doped BNNTs case, the spin-up band structure shows a wide band gap semiconductor, while the spin-down band structure illustrates a n-type semiconductor. All defected BNNTs have a 1.0 mu B total magnetic moment. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2008.},

Electrical conductivity of the undoped and boron-doped carbon nanotubes reveal a 3-dimensional variable-range-hopping conductivity over a wide range of temperature, viz. from room temperature down to 2 K. The electrical conductivity is not found to be changed significantly by the present levels of B-doping.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies were carried out in the range 400-4000 cm(-1) to study the attachment of nitrogen impurities on carbon nanotubes. FTIR spectra of the virgin sample of MWNTs show dominant peaks which are corresponding to Si-O, C-N, N-CH3, CNT, C-O, and C-H-x, respectively. The Si-O peak has its origin in silicon substrate whereas the other peaks are due to the precursor gases present in the gas mixture. The peaks are sharp and highly intense showing the chemisorption nature of the dipole bond. The intensity of the peaks due to N-CH3, C-N, and C-H reduces after annealing. It is interesting to note that these peaks vanish on annealing at high temperature (900 degrees C). The presence of C-N peak may imply the doping of the MWNTs with N in substitution mode. The position of this intense peak is in agreement with the reported peak in carbon nitride samples prepared by plasma CVD process, since the Raman modes are also expected to be delocalized over both carbon and nitrogen sites it was found that the intensity ratio of the D and G peaks, /(D)//(G), varies as a function of ammonia concentration. The TGA measurements, carried out under argon flow, show that the dominant weight loss of the sample occurs in the temperature range 400-600 degrees C corresponding to the removal of the impurities and amorphous carbon.},

TGA/DTA measurements, carried out under argon flow, show that the dominant weight loss of the sample occurs in the temperature range 400-600 degrees C corresponding to the removal of the impurities and amorphous carbon.

  abstract = {A gas-phase process of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) formation, based on thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl or ferrocene in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO), was investigated in ambient pressure laminar flow reactors in the temperature range of 600-1300 [degree sign]C. Ferrocene was found to be a better catalyst precursor in the studied conditions since iron pentacarbonyl decomposes at lower temperatures resulting in the excessive growth of catalyst particles. In situ sampling carried out at 1000 [degree sign]C showed that the SWCNT growth occurred from individual metal particles in the heating section of the furnace in the temperature range of 891-928 [degree sign]C, in which the growth rate was estimated to exceed . FT-IR measurements of gaseous products revealed that the majority of the CO disproportionation took place on the reactor walls. Raman measurements confirmed the results of TEM observations, namely, the formation of very high purity SWCNT product. On-line aerosol number size distributions were measured to detect the conditions of SWCNT formation and the product morphology changes. Mechanism of SWCNT formation in the gas phase from ferrocene and CO is discussed.},

To this aim, a 10 angstrom length of BNNT consisting of 24 B atoms and 24 N atoms was selected where the end atoms are capped by hydrogen atoms. To follow the purpose, six C atoms were doped instead of three B and three N atoms as a central ring in the surface of the C-doped BNNT.

In this paper, we propose an advanced structure with the integration of the focusing, beam correction (stigmator) electrodes and metallic ring array for detection of secondary electrons emitted from the wafer. Initial results of utilizing boron doped diamond and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) emitters are presented. Both diamond and the CNTs were selectively grown using a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HF-CVD) technique. Results of field emission improvement of the bundle CNTs on a Si tip array by hydrogen (H-2) treatment are demonstrated. The improvements of the emission current and the long-term stability were attributed to the reduction of the CNTs work function by the formation of C-H bonds.},

  abstract = {The outstanding properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are often impaired by the presence of structural defects, such as vacancies, as consequence of peculiar growth techniques or electron irradiation. However, the changes in the electronic structure due to the presence of defects can also induce the formation of sites at the sidewall exhibiting unusual reactive properties. In particular, monovacancies constitute active reaction sites toward the addition of different kinds of adsorbates, which can potentially cure the defects and restore the properties of pristine nanotubes. In this work, the interaction of carbon monoxide with monovacancies on single-walled CNTs is investigated by means of an integrated approach, based on density functional theory, consisting of both static and molecular dynamics calculations for the evaluation of potential-energy minima and free-energy barriers. Our simulations suggest viable reaction routes for the healing of single vacancies on the sidewall by subsequent interaction with two CO molecules, leading to the restoration of a perfect hexagonal carbon-atom network. The outlined results clarify the role of CO as precursor for the growth of nanotubes both as carbon source and as active chemical species for the formation of a defect-free sidewall.},

The byproducts of pyrolysis were monitored by mass spectrometry. The carbon formed from silica precursors was washed with KOH to remove the silica and HCl to remove metal particles, whereas the carbon formed from magnesia samples was washed with HCl to remove the support and the metal. The solid carbon product was characterized with N-2 physisorption to measure surface area and pore volume distribution, X-ray diffraction to deter-mine the crystalline phases present, and temperature-programmed oxidation to determine ash and nitrogen content. Magnesia was more readily removed from the carbon compared with silica. A significant amount of metal., encased in carbon, remained in the samples after washing. The Co particles led to a higher content of bulk nitrogen in the carbon, as high as 2.9\% based on oxidation measurements. Electron microscopy imaging confirmed that all of the metal particles catalyzed the formation of various types of carbon nanofibers, with the diameter and structure of the fibers varying with different metal-support precursor combinations. A possible application for these fibers is oxygen reduction reaction catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cell cathodes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We performed a series of experiments with and without Fe element as the catalyst and in the presence of C2H2 gas for producing boron doped CNTs. At the second stage and in the presence of an Fe catalyst, C2H2 gas and nitrogen, N-2, gas were used for producing nitrogen doped CNTs.

  abstract = {Distribution of the probability current and the probability density of wave packets was calculated for nanotubes and nanotube Y junctions by solving the three dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a jellium potential model of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip-nanotube-support system. Four systems were investigated: an infinite single wall nanotube (SWNT) as reference case, a capped SWNT protruding a step of the support surface, a quantum dot (finite tube without support), and a SWNT Y junction. It is found that the spatial distribution of the probability current flowing into the sample is decided by the electron probability density of the tube and by the oscillation in time of the probability current, which in turn is governed by the quasibound states on the tube. For the infinite tube the width of the axial spreading of the wave packet during tunneling is about 5 nm. When the STM tip is above that part of the tube which protrudes from the atomic scale step of the support surface it is found that the current flows ballistically along the tube and the total transmission is the same as for the infinite tube. In the case of quantum dot, however, the finite tube is first charged in a short time then it is discharged very slowly through the tip-nanotube tunnel junction. In the Y junction both the above the junction and off the junction tip positions were investigated. For a 1.2 nm displacement of the tip from the junction the wave packet still “samples” the junction point which means that in STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments the signature of the junction should be still present for such tip displacement. For all tunneling situations analyzed the tunnel current is mainly determined by the tip-nanotube junction owing to its large resistance. The tunneling event through the STM model is characterized by two time scales, the nanotube is quickly “charged” with the wave packet coming from the tip then this “charge” flows into the support 50 times slower.},

  abstract = {The differences in the electrochemical oxidation of two commonly known catecholamines, dopamine and norepinephrine, and one catechol, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), at three different types of carbon based electrodes comprising conventionally polished glassy carbon (GC), nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), and non-doped CNTs were assessed. Raman microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to evaluate structural and compositional properties. Raman measurements indicate that N-CNT electrodes have ca. 2.4 times more edge plane sites over non-doped CNTs. XPS data show no evidence of oxygen functionalities at the surface of either CNT type. N-CNTs possess 4.0 at. \% nitrogen as pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary nitrogen functionalities that result in positively charged carbon surfaces in neutral and acidic solutions. The electrochemical behavior of the various carbon electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry conducted in pH 5.8 acetate buffer. Semiintegral analysis of the voltammograms reveals a significant adsorptive character of dopamine and norepinephrine oxidation at N-CNT electrodes. Larger peak splittings, Delta E-p, for the cyclic voltammograms of both catecholamines and a smaller Delta E-p for the cyclic voltammogram for DOPAC at N-CNT electrodes suggest that electrostatic interactions hinder oxidation of cationic dopamine and norepinephrine, but facilitate anionic DOPAC oxidation. These observations were supported by titrimetry of solid suspensions to determine the pH of point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) and estimate the number of basic sites for both CNT varieties. This study demonstrates that carbon purity, the presence of exposed edge plane sites, surface charge, and basicity of CNTs are important factors for influencing adsorption and enhancing the electrochemical oxidation of catecholamines and catechols.},

Since these materials are undesirable for the studying of the intrinsic properties of the nanotubes, we have undertaken a purification process using chemical and physical methods to separate the different components. We show here that most impurities can be removed by successive cycles of washing, sonication, and centrifugation. Furthermore, the two different types of boron nitride nanostructures i.e., BN-SWNTs and BN-cages can be isolated. Efficiency of the separation was monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the different steps of the process. Finally, we envisage the further purification of the nanotubes-enriched fraction by functionalizing the nanotubes in a non covalent manner by specific polymers as for carbon nanotubes and BN multi-walled nanotubes.},

XPS and Raman microscopy were used to assess quantitatively the compositional and structural properties of the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). XPS analysis indicates a shift in and broadening of the C 1s spectra track with increasing disorder induced by selective nitrogen doping. N Is XPS spectra show three principle types of nitrogen coordination (pyridinic, pyrolic, and quaternary), with the pyridinic-like fraction selectively increased from 0.0 to 4.5 at.\%. First-order Raman spectra were fit with five peaks that vary in intensity and width with nitrogen content. The ratio of the D and G bands' integrated intensities scaled linearly with nitrogen content. Iodimetric titrations were used to gauge the number of reducing sites on as-prepared N-CNTs, representing the first report of nitrogen doping as a means to deterministically effect the chemical reactivities of carbon nanotubes. The reported methodology for the regulated growth and selective nitrogen doping of CNTs presents new ways to study systematically the influence of nanocarbon composition and structure on chemical and electrochemical reactivity for a host of applications.

As-formed nanotube layers were annealed to an anatase structure and treated. in ammonia environment at 550 degrees C to achieve nitrogen doping. The crystal structure, morphology, composition and photoresponse of the N-doped were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemical measurements. Results clearly show that successful N-doping of the TiO2 nanotubular layers can be achieved upon ammonia treatment. The magnitude of the photoresponse in ultraviolet and visible light is strongly dependent on the thicknesses of the layers. This effect is ascribed to recombination effects along the tube length.},

As a result, the nanotube changes from a metal to a semiconductor. We also study the disorder effect on linear optical absorption in doped nanotubes. It is demonstrated that the linear optical absorption can be greatly suppressed due to the collapse of the discrete spatial symmetry in heavily doped nanotubes.

  abstract = {Catalytically synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) such as those prepared via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) contain metallic impurities including Fe, Ni, Co, and Mo. Transition metal contaminants such as Fe can participate in redox cycling reactions that catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species and other products. Through the nature of the CVD growth process, metallic nanoparticles become encased within the CNT graphene lattice and may still be chemically accessible and participate in redox chemistry, especially when these materials are utilized as electrodes in electrochemical applications. We demonstrate that metallic impurities can be selectively dissolved and/or passivated during electrochemical potential cycling. Anomalous Fe dissolution and passivation behavior is observed in neutral (pH = 6.40 +/- 0.03) aqueous solutions when using multiwalled CNTs prepared from CVD. Fe particles contained within these CNTs display intriguing, potential-dependent Fe redox activity that varies with supporting electrolyte composition. In neutral solutions containing dibasic sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, and sodium citrate, Fell dissolution and surface confined Fe-II/III redox activity are significant despite Fe being encapsulated within CNT graphene layers. However, no apparent Fe dissolution is observed in I M potassium nitrate solutions, suggesting that the electrolyte composition plays an important role in observing Fell dissolution, passivation, and surface confined Fe-II/III redox activity. Between potentials of 0 and -1.1 V versus Hg/Hg2SO4, the primary redox-active Fe species are surface Fe-II/III oxides/oxyhydroxides. This Fe-II/III surface oxide redox chemistry can be completely suppressed by passivating Fe through repeated cycling of the CNTs in supporting electrolyte. By increasing the potential to more negative values ({\textgreater} -1.3 V), Fe-II/III dissolution may be induced in electrolyte solutions containing acetate and phosphate and inhibited by addition of sodium benzoate, which adsorbs on exposed Fe particles, effectively passivating them. Finally, we observe that the Fe-II/III redox chemistry or subsequent passivation does not affect the onset of oxygen reduction at nitrogen-doped CNTs, suggesting that the surface-bound Fell species is not the primary catalytically active site for oxygen reduction in these materials.},

  abstract = {Diamond films with different grain morphologies were prepared in order to compare their field electron emission properties. For the diamond films with well-oriented grains, the field electron emission properties are enhanced when the grain shape changes from flat to flattened pyramid and then to pyramid due to the increase in the field enhancement factors. Compared with the well-oriented diamond films, the diamond film with randomly oriented grains exhibits larger emission current due, to the increase in the effective emission area. For the diamond film with cauliflowerlike grains, the nanotip structures improve the electron emission properties significantly through an increase in both the field enhancement factor and the effective emission area.

An experimental set up has been built that allows the screening of thermionic coatings and new nanomaterials from room temperature to 2000 K in high vacuum and at gap sizes as small as 1 mum. A new class of very high temperature compatible materials, carbon nanotubes, has been investigated for their performance as cathodes. Seven different types of carbon nanotubes have been screened as thermionic emitter cathodes and compared to tungsten and nitrogen doped diamond. It has been found that some carbon nanotubes combine excellent temperature stability with good thermal emission performance. Yet, other carbon nanotubes exhibited exceptional combined thermal and field enhanced emission performance.},

We show that the dopant atom displacement energy and thus the electron threshold energy is lower for nanotubes with smaller diameter and that, independent of the nanotube diameter, the dopant nitrogen atoms can be displaced more easily than the host carbon atoms. Our results set a limit on the threshold electron energy for damage production in N-doped tubes and indicate that spatially localized electron irradiation of doped nanotubes can be used for local atomic and band structure engineering.},

Both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process of the graphene layers are controlled by the corresponding energy barriers, which show significant dependence on the number of layers.

The highly ordered vertically oriented nanotube arrays were obtained, and the nanotubes were open at the top end with an average diameter of approximately 80 nm. Analysis by XPS indicated that the introduced boron was probably incorporated into TiO2 and that the chemical environmental surrounding boron might be Ti-B-O. The boron-doped sample with a mixture of anatase and rutile was identified by X-ray diffraction. A shift of the absorption edge to a lower energy in the spectrum of the UV-vis absorption was observed. Under both UV and 400-620 nm visible light irradiation, the B-doped TiO2 nanotube array electrode exhibited a higher photoconversion efficiency than the non-doped one, a notable photoconversion efficiency of 31.5\% was achieved under high-pressure mercury lamp irradiation, and a photoconversion efficiency of 15.1\% on the B-doped electrode was obtained under lambda {\textgreater} 290 nm light irradiation.

Other defects such as substitutional impurities and pentagon-heptagon defect pairs on tube walls are shown to produce interesting effects on the conductance. The effects of static external perturbations on the transport properties of metallic nanotubes and doped semiconducting nanotubes are examined, with the metallic tubes being much less affected by long-range disorder. The structure and properties of crossed nanotube junctions and ropes of nanotubes have also been studied. The rich interplay between the structural and the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes gives rise to new phenomena and the possibility of nanoscale device applications.},

The presence of impurity breaks the uniformity of current distribution around the carbon rings. For the more electronegative impurity of nitrogen, the current density is attracted toward the side of the tube where the N atom is located; but for the less electronegative impurity of boron, the opposite happens. Accordingly there appears a chiral flow of current in the B- and N-doped armchair nanotube near the impurity.},

  abstract = {In this study, polypyrrole (PPy) films were electrochemically deposited on gold substrates roughened by a triangular-wave oxidation-reduction cycle (ORC) in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 N KCl. The results indicate that the intensity of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of PPy significantly depends on the ORC scans. Correspondingly, the superficial complex formed on the roughened gold has a strong influence on the SERS effect. The optimum Raman signal of PPy deposited on Au roughened with 25 scans in ORC is ca. 300 times larger than that of PPy deposited on Au without ORC treatment. Meanwhile, the (220) face of Au partly changes into the (111) face with the lowest surface energy after ORC roughening. Toward higher frequency, a shift of C=C backbone stretching of PPy situated at ca. 1575 cm 1 in the SERS spectrum was found which is attributed to interfacial charge transfer from electrodeposited pyrrolylium nitrogen to the roughened gold. Furthermore, this study shows that the SERS enhancement of PPy electropolymerized on roughened Au mainly arises from the chemical effect between PPy and the Au-containing complex.},

Raman spectroscopy, EELS, and optical data are consistent with the picture that a few atom \% boron has been substituted for carbon in the sp(2) framework of SWNTs. Finally, our results show that boron doping does not significantly affect the optical transmittance in the visible region. However, boron doping lowers the sheet resistance by similar to 30\% relative to pristine SWNT films from the same batch. Boron-doped SWNT may provide a better approach to touch-screen technology.},

Interstitial F doping can significantly change the interwall interaction and can lead to evident changes in structural and electronic properties of such doped system. As a result, both tube walls turn into effective conducting channels, which makes a significant contribution to the enhancement of electrical conductivity of fluorine-functionalized MWBNNTs. In contrast, the F adsorption on the exterior surface of the outmost tube hardly alters the interwall interaction and only affects the structural and electronic properties of the outer tube wall. Our work indicates that the electronic properties of MWBNNTs could be significantly modulated by adjusting the interwall interaction.},

Such a titania nanotube array shows very good stability at high field emission current (fluctuation {\textless}3\% at field emission current of 160 mu A within 4 h) and low turn-on and threshold fields (11.2 and 24.4 V mu m(-1), respectively) because of the coexistence of doped nitrogen and concomitant oxygen vacancies in titania nanotubes. This work demonstrates the possibility of converting pure titania nanotubes without field emission into a favorable and efficient one through the introduction of acceptor states and donor states both above the valence band maximum and below the conduction band minimum in the band gap of titania by the doped nitrogen and concomitant oxygen vacancies, respectively. Application of this doping concept to other transition metal oxides can be expected to broaden the scope of field emission materials.},

Based on our experimental results, the growth of carbon nanotube arrays in our experimental condition could not be diffusion-limited. The measured activation energy could possibly be attributed to the heterogeneous decomposition of acetylene over the catalyst particle. Furthermore the marked array with special segmental structure may be found some applications in the future.},

The Mg dopant is apparently responsible for their formation since the oxygen concentration in the MOCVD-grown samples was orders of magnitude lower than in the bulk samples. Mg segregation on these planes apparently does not allow uniform continuous growth on these planes leading to these hollow defects. Some defects in the heterolayers also develop into longer nanotubes elongated along the c axis.

The results show that the role of nitrogen may be summarized as follows: by comparing with hydrogen plasma, the bombardment energy of nitrogen plasma is greater. Therefore, the presence of nitrogen during CNT growth can keep the front catalyst surface clean and active to prolong surface passivation to enhance carbon bulk diffusion. The higher temperature due to higher bombardment energy of nitrogen plasma can promote agglomeration effects during catalyst pretreatment and the initial stage of CNT growth to produce larger size nano-particles. The presence of nitrogen is a favorable condition for formation of the bamboo-like CNTs, but not a necessary condition. Another favorable condition for formation of the bamboo-like CNTs is to deposit CNTs by ECR-CVD.},

The small diamagnetic susceptibility and the weak temperature variation of the g factor, which is observed in the narrow conduction-electron spin resonance (CESR), indicate a Fermi level shift of similar to 0.2 eV, according to the quasi-two-dimensional graphite band model. The temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility reveals considerable enhancement compared to undoped MWNTs and the presence of thermally activated behavior, complying with an increased density of states and the formation of localized impurity states close to the Fermi level. Line-shape analysis of the CESR spectra in terms of two separate spin systems implies enhanced doping inhomogeneity.},

Therefore, the present study demonstrates the full potential of the CVD gas flow reactions in continuous production of high quality SWNTs. Comparable syntheses were conducted using other alcohols in place of ethanol and it was found that high alkyl alcohols like isopropanol and hexanol produced more amorphous carbon while methanol produced no carbon. The high yield growth of SWNTs was attributed greatly to the reaction chemistry of ethanol and the 'right' amount of hydrogen in the system, as discussed.},

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy are used to characterize isolated nanotubes grown from the discrete nanoparticles. The characterizations, carried out at single-tube and single-particle level, obtain clear evidence that the diameters of nanotubes are determined by the diameters of catalytic nanoparticles. With nanoparticles placed on ultrathin alumina membranes, isolated SWNTs are grown and directly examined by transmission electron microscopy. For the first time, both ends of an as-grown single-walled nanotube are imaged by TEM, leading to a microscopic picture of nanotube growth mechanism.

Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite.

The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5\%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.},

  abstract = {NANOCAT������ Superfine Fe2O3 nanoparticles were evaluated both as a catalyst and as an oxidant for carbon monoxide oxidation. It was found that the nanoparticles are much more effective as carbon monoxide catalysts than the non-nano oxide powder. For the Fe2O3 nanoparticles, the reaction order is first-order with respect to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide, and zero-order with respect to the partial pressure of oxygen. The apparent activation energy was 14.5���������kcal���������mol-1 and the normalized reaction rate was 19���������s-1���������m-2 at 300������������������C. In the absence of oxygen, Fe2O3 nanoparticles oxidize carbon monoxide directly as an oxidant. The resulting reduced forms of Fe2O3 also catalyze a disproportionation reaction for a considerable amount of carbon monoxide. The significant amount of carbon monoxide it can remove through the catalytic oxidation, direct oxidation, and the disproportionation reaction make it a very promising material in certain special applications, such as removing the carbon monoxide from a burning cigarette, where the potential toxicity of other, more conventional catalysts would be undesirable. The higher activity of Fe2O3 nanoparticles over non-nano Fe2O3 powders was attributed to a small particle size (3���������nm), the presence of an hydroxylated phase of iron oxide (FeOOH), as revealed by both high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and a comparable study of FeOOH (goethite) powder.},

The concentration of the nitrogen atoms has been controlled in the range 2-6 atomic \%, by the flow rate of ammonia. All nanotubes exhibit a bamboo-like structure over this temperature range. The growth rate is insensitive to this nitrogen content, but the structure is strongly dependent on it. As the nitrogen content increases, the thicker compartment layers form uniformly at a regular distance and the relative amount of crystalline graphitic sheets is notably reduced. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals the higher nitrogen concentration and the lower crystallinity for the compartment layers compared to the wall. The growth of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes has been explained using a base growth mechanism proposed for carbon nanotubes. We suggest that the nitrogen doping would produce more flexible compartment layers connecting the wall under a less strain.},

This crude powder was stabilised by an annealing up to 1800 degrees C under nitrogen atmosphere leading to a very stable compound exhibiting a specific area of more than 300 m(2).g(-1) and presenting a very specific nanometric spherical texture. Some samples were doped with platinum (about I wt.\%) to enhance the activity of pure h-BN using an original one step synthesis route starting from a mixture of BN and Pt precursors. Attempts to sequester hydrogen into these powders were made successfully at -196 degrees C under 10 Mpa, but the stored amount was only about 0.3 wt.\% and the platinum added BN powders did not lead to an enhancement of the storage capacity.},

Adsorbed atomic hydrogen impurities can either induce a local antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, or nonmagnetic state depending on their density and relative distribution. To describe the various magnetic possibilities of hydrogenated graphene, a self-consistent Hubbard Hamiltonian, optimized by ab initio calculations, is first solved in the mean field approximation for small graphene cells. Then, an efficient order N Kubo transport methodology is implemented, enabling large scale simulations of functionalized graphene. Depending on the underlying intrinsic magnetic ordering of hydrogen-induced spins, remarkably different transport features are predicted for the same impurity concentration. Indeed, while the disordered nonmagnetic graphene system exhibits a transition from diffusive to localization regimes, the intrinsic ferromagnetic state exhibits unprecedented robustness toward quantum interference, maintaining, for certain resonant energies, a quasiballistic regime up to the micrometer scale. Consequently, low temperature transport measurements could unveil the presence of a magnetic state in weakly hydrogenated graphene.},

But the confinement energy due to the rolling up of the h-BN sheet cannot explain a gap width of the boron nitride nanotubes below the h-BN gap.

Then the obtained nanotubes were immersed in a 0.5 mol/L NH3 solution for different periods. Finally, the resulted products were calcinated at high temperature to complete the substitution of O by N. The prepared N-doped nanotubes had an anatase structure and a large specific surface area. For those N-doped TiO2 nanotubes, a significant shift of the absorption edge to a lower energy region and a notable decomposition of methyl orange in an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation were observed. The most visible light active catalysts were those immersed in a 0.5 mol/L NH3 solution for 10 h and then calcinated at 400 degrees C for 1 h.},

However, defect formation in the C network during deoxygenation compromises the charge carrier mobility in the reduced material. Understanding the mechanisms of the thermal reactions is essential for defining alternative routes able to limit the density of defects generated by carbon evolution. Here, we identify a dual path mechanism in the thermal reduction of graphene oxide driven by the oxygen coverage: at low surface density, the O atoms adsorbed as epoxy groups evolve as O2 leaving the C network unmodified. At higher coverage, the formation of other O-containing species opens competing reaction channels, which consume the C backbone. We combined spectroscopic tools and ab initio calculations to probe the species residing on the surface and those released in the gas phase during heating and to identify reaction pathways and rate-limiting steps. Our results illuminate the current puzzling scenario of the low temperature gasification of graphene oxide.},

  abstract = {Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is the only probing technique that allows for the investigation of both the topography and the electronic structure of carbon nanosystems at a subnanometer resolution. The interpretation of the STM images of carbon nanostructures involves complications that are normally absent in the study of planar crystalline surfaces. The complications typically appear from a number of quantum effects responsible for distortions in the microscope image of a nano-object. Because of these difficulties, computer simulation plays an extremely important role in the analysis of experimental data. In the current article, we report on two theoretical approaches developed for aiding in the interpretation and understanding of the formation of the STM image of a nanotube: first, the quantum mechanical dynamics of a wave packet, which allows for the modeling of the flow of the tunneling current between a tip and a nanotube supported by a substrate; and, second, a tight-binding perturbation theory that allows for the explicit calculation of realistic STM images and scanning tunneling spectra of carbon nanostructures. An atlas of computed STM images is provided for a series of 27 single-wall nanotubes with diameter around 1.3 nm. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper, we present a two-equation model that can predict the formation process of iron nanoparticles from ferrocene fed into a CVD reactor. The model, combined with an axisymmetric two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, includes the mechanism of nucleation and surface growth of an iron particle and bi-particle collision. The model predicts that the diameter of a particle will increase with an increase in the reaction temperature or the radial distance from the center of the reactor. Iron particles may deposit on the reactor wall; our model predicts that the thickness of the layer consisting of deposited iron particles will decrease with an increase in the axial distance from the entrance. The first prediction was validated by experimental observations reported by other researchers. In addition to the CFD simulation, a dimensional analysis was conducted to find pi-numbers that govern the process of particle formation; three pi-numbers were identified. Furthermore, one-dimensional governing equations were obtained under the assumptions of constant diffusion coefficient and collision frequency function, and solutions for particle diameter were obtained in qualitative agreement with the earlier CFD simulations.},

Therefore, HiPco(R) samples contain an unusual wide selection of different nanotubes. Combining this feature with different dopant molecule sizes makes it possible to study a special, diameter selective intercalation phenomenon. Here we present a comparative resonant Raman spectroscopic study on the n-type (K) and p-type (FeCl3) doping of a HiPco(R) and a laser ablation grown SWCNT sample. Diameter selectivity is observed in the former but not in the latter case. We suggest that the solvability of dopands is diameter dependent with a minimum in the range d = 0.9-1.2 nm.},

We have shown theoretically by explicit integrations for the resonant Raman cross section that the D-band intensity of an isolated SWCNT has a sharp maximum when E-laser of either the incoming or the scattered photon matches a van Hove singularity in the joint density of states. This `resonance' must be considered in addition to the double resonance from a scattering by an impurity.

It is found that the yield of the nanotubes, the quality of the layer packing, and nitrogen content in the CNx nanotubes depend on the catalyst composition. XPS of the N Is spectra show that nitrogen atoms are in two different electronic states in the carbon nanotubes. According to quantum chemical calculations these states can be ascribed to nitrogen atoms substituting for carbon atoms in the graphite network and pyridine-like atoms.

We further demonstrate that the formation energy of a double vacancy in nanotubes is smaller than that for a single vacancy, a behavior different from most monatomic solids, including graphite.},

By using the result of different doping rates in the (10,0) tube, we extrapolate the result to low boron density limit and find that the ionization energy of the acceptor impurity level should be approximately 0.2 eV. Furthermore, we discuss the doping rate dependence of the density of states at the Fermi level, which is important to realize superconductivity.},

We also show how the presence of nitrogen in the precursor changed the nanotube morphology, i.e. nitrogen decreased the number of kinks incorporated into the carbon nanotubes, decreased their length and diameter and increased the proportion of `bamboo' shaped nanotubes. Furthermore, due to the nitrogen doping, the oxidation resistance of the nanotube material was decreased. With concentrations above 10\% benzylamine the increase of the reaction temperature had no significant effect on the quality of the nanotubes, however, at higher temperatures the nitrogen content was decreased. We demonstrate the control over the nanotube geometry, the nitrogen content and oxidation resistance of the nanotubes, and show that these properties are interlinked. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The electronic structures of the B, C, and N atoms were thoroughly probed by synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the X-ray absorption near-edge structure method. The B0.45C0.1N0.45 NTs contain a significant amount of B-C and C-N bonding with a pyridine-like structure (hole structure), which reduces the pi bonding states of the B and N atoms. From the XPS valence band spectrum, the band gap was estimated to be about 2.8 eV. In the BN-C NTs, the C and BN domains are separated without forming the pyridine-like structure. Using the first principles method, we investigated the relative stabilities and electronic structures of the various isomers of the double-walled (12,0)@(20,0) BCN NTs. The C-outerlayer BN nanotube structure is the most stable isomer, when there exist no defects in the tubes with B/N = 1.0 (i.e., graphite-like structure). In addition, a reasonable model, which is characterized by the motives consisted of three pyridine-like rings around a hollow site, is presented for the local structure of C atoms in the B0.45N0.45C0.1 NTs. A considerable decrease of the band gap due to the 10\% C doping was predicted, which was consistent with the experimental results.},

As the temperature increases from 700 to 1000 degreesC, the growth rate of CNTs increases by a factor of approximately 45 and the average diameter increases from 30 to 80 nm. The CNTs grown using FePc exhibit about 2 times higher growth rate than those using CoPc and NiPc. The CNTs usually have a cylindrical structure, and a bamboo-like structure with a larger diameter at the higher temperature. The CNTs are doped with 2-6 at. \% nitrogen atoms. The nitrogen content tends to decrease with the temperature increase. The CNTs grown using NiPc contain a higher nitrogen concentration compared to those grown using FePc and CoPc. The degree of crystalline perfection of the graphitic sheets increases with the temperature, but depends on the catalyst and the nitrogen content. The Arrhenius plot provides the activation energy 30 +/- 3 kcal/mol for all three sources, which is similar to the diffusion energy of carbon in bulk metal. This suggests that the bulk diffusion of carbon plays a decisive role in the growth of CNTs. The strain for the joint between the compartment layer and the wall determines the structure of the CNTs.},

The van Hove singularity transitions (E-11(S), E-22(S), E-11(M)) in absorption spectroscopy disappeared gradually with an increasing doping concentration and a new peak appeared at a high doping concentration. The work function was downshifted up to 0.42 eV by a strong charge transfer from the SWCNTs to AuCl3 by a high level of p-doping. We propose that this large work function shift forces the Fermi level of the SWCNTs to be located deep in the valence band, i.e., highly degenerate, creating empty van Hove singularity states, and hence the work function shift invokes a new asymmetric transition in the absorption spectroscopy from a deeper level to newly generated empty states.},

Here we report the first nanoscale images of single wall nanotubes (SWNTs) whose sidewalls have been chemically derivatized, Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of fluorinated SWNTs reveal a dramatic banded structure which indicates broad continuous regions of fluorination terminating abruptly in bands orthogonal to the tube axis. This pattern is consistent with an energetically favored addition mechanism where fluorine atoms add around the circumference of the tube. STM images of sparsely butylated SWNTs, for which fluorinated SWNTs served as precursor, are also reported. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The concentration of electrically active impurities in in situ boron (B)-doped silicon (Si) nanowires (SiNws) synthesized by gold (Au)-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is studied by Raman spectroscopy. B-doped SiNWs exhibit an asymmetric Raman spectrum due to Fano resonance between discrete phonon Raman scattering and continuous electric Raman scattering caused by the excitation of holes in the valence band. To quantitatively evaluate the concentration of active B atoms from the asymmetric spectral shape, the spectra are fitted by a Fano resonance formula and asymmetry parameters are extracted. From the comparison of the asymmetry parameter with those obtained for reference samples, the concentration of active B atoms in SiNWs is estimated. The effects of thermal annealing in nitrogen and oxygen gases on the active B concentration are also studied. The annealing in nitrogen ambience for a short period significantly increases the concentration of active B atoms especially when the doping level is high, while longer period annealing decreases the active B concentration. The reduction of active B concentration is more significant when SiNWs are annealed in oxygen gas ambience. By combining Raman results with high-resolution transmission electron microscope observations, the growth mechanism of B-doped SiNWs is discussed. We show that the number of B atoms doped into SiNWs via Au catalysts is very limited and high B concentration layers are grown by conformal growth on the sidewall of SiNWs.},

  abstract = {We report the catalytic effect on the synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were grown vertically aligned on the iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (M) catalytic nanoparticles deposited on alumina substrates by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene in the temperature range 900-1000 degreesC. We also synthesized them on the silicon oxide substrates by pyrolyzing iron phthalocyanine (FePc), cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), and nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) at 700-1000 degreesC. In both syntheses, the CNTs grown using Fe exhibit about 2 times higher growth rate than those using Co and Ni. As the temperature rises from 700 to 1000 degreesC, the growth rate of CNTs increases by a factor of 45. The Arrhenius plot of growth rates provides the activation energy 30 +/- 3 kcal/mol for all three catalysts, which is similar with the diffusion energy of carbon in bulk metal. It suggests that the bulk diffusion of carbon would play a decisive role in the growth of CNTs. The diameter of CNTs is in the range of 20-100 nm, showing an increase with the temperature. As the diameter is below 30 nm, the CNTs usually exhibit a cylindrical structure. The CNTs were intrinsically doped with the nitrogen content 2-6 atomic \%. The degree of crystalline perfection of the graphitic sheets increases with the temperature, but depends on the catalyst and the nitrogen content. The graphitic sheets of CNTs grown using Fe are better crystalline than those grown using Co and Ni. As the nitrogen content increases, the degree of crystalline perfection decreases and the structure becomes the bamboo-like structure probably due to a release of strains.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the doping effect of two types of multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different aspect ratios on MgB2/Fe monofilament wires. Relationships between microstructure, magnetic critical current density (J(c)), critical temperature (T-c), upper critical field (H-c2), and irreversibility field (H-irr) for pure and CNT doped wires were systematically studied for sintering temperature from 650 to 1000 degrees C. As the sintering temperature increased, T-c for short CNT doped sample slightly decreased, while T-c for long CNT doped sample increased. This indicates better reactivity between MgB2 and short CNT due to its small aspect ratio, and substitution of carbon (C) from short CNT for boron (B) occurs. In addition, short CNT doped samples sintered at high temperatures of 900 and 1000 degrees C exhibited excellent J(c), and this value was approximately 10(4)A/cm(2) in fields up to 8 T at 5 K. This suggests that short CNT is a promising carbon source for MgB2 superconductor with excellent J(c). In particular, inclusion of nanosized MgO particles and substitution of C into the MgB2 lattice could result in strong flux pinning centers. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {The experimental literature on the pyrolysis of C2H2 is reviewed and summarized. These observations divide naturally into three temperature regimes: (i) T \&lt; 1100 K, where the homogeneous reaction is a molecular polymerization; (ii) 1100 \&lt; T \&lt; 1800 K, where the process is still dominated by a molecular polymerization, but a fragment radical chain is clearly involved; and (iii) T \&gt; 1800 K, where a fragment chain carried by C2H and H drives a polymerization to polyacetylenes. A combined molecular/fragment chain mechanism is developed and applied to the modeling of three shock-tube studies which span the two higher-temperature regimes. The core of the mechanism is a set of 5 mainly molecular reactions whose rates are derived from an application of unimolecular rate theory and detailed balance to recent measurements on the decomposition of vinylacetylene. The combination of this core with consequent fragment radical reactions provides a satisfactory description of most features of the chosen experiments including several-isotope exchange, hydrogenation to C2H4, and C6H2 formation-which are almost entirely the result of fragment radical chain reaction. Possible detailed paths for the molecular dimerization are suggested and some possible molecular paths for the ?Berthelot synthesis? of benzene are also proposed.},

The kinetics of film growth was rationalized in terms of the electrochemical process in short-circuited corrosion cell. The presented mechanism of film growth at the gas/liquid interface upgrades the previously suggested model of carbonization of solid fluoropolymers by alkali metal amalgams.

  abstract = {Electron-phonon coupling and the normal and possible superconducting states in the monoanions of B, N-substituted acenes such as B3N3H6, B5N5H8, and B7N7H10 are studied. The results for B, N-substituted acenes are compared with those for acenes. The B-N stretching modes around 1500 cm-1 and the low-frequency modes, less and more, respectively, strongly couple to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) with an increase in molecular size from B3N3H6 to B7N7H10. The relationship between the intrinsic intramolecular conductivity and the intramolecular electronic structures is investigated, and it is found that the intrinsic high conductivity needs small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the LUMO, the high frequency modes which play an essential role in the electron-phonon interactions, and large number of atoms. The relationship between the normal and superconducting states in acenes is compared with that in B, N-substituted acenes. Both possible superconducting transition temperatures and the intrinsic normal conductivity in acenes are estimated to be larger than those in the same size of B, N-substituted acenes. These results argue against the interesting apparent paradox in conventional superconductivity; the higher resistivity at room temperature, the more likely it is that a metal will be a superconductor when cooled. That is because the frequencies of the vibrational modes which play an important role in the electron-phonon interactions in negatively charged B, N-substituted acenes are much lower than those in negatively charged acenes because of electronegativity perturbation. In conventional superconductivity, such frequencies depend mainly on the atomic masses. However, such frequencies depend on the detailed intramolecular electronic structures as well as the molecular weights in nano-sized molecular systems. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

The low frequency modes around 500 cm-1 as well as the frequency modes higher than 1000 cm-1 strongly couple to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) in 1f and 2f.

That is, the l(LUMO) value increases much more significantly by H-F substitution than by H-D substitution in B, N-substituted acenes. The larger displacements of B and N atoms in the vibronic active modes in 1f and 2f than those in 1d and 2d due to larger atomic mass of fluorine than that of deuterium, and the phase patterns difference between the LUMO in 1f and 2f, in which the atomic orbitals between N and its neighboring F atoms form strong sigma-antibonding interactions, and that in 1d and 2d, in which the atomic orbitals between two neighboring B and N atoms form weak pi-bonding and pi-antibonding interactions, are the main reason why the l(LUMO) value increases much more significantly by H-F substitution than by H-D substitution.

  abstract = {Electrochemical n- and p-doping of a supramolecular assembly of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a heteroleptic Ru(II)-bipyridine complex (coded Z-907Na) was studied by in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry with laser excitation energies of 2.18 and 2.41 eV. Whereas the Raman lines assigned to the nanotube (RBM and G-bands) attenuate their intensities upon both n- and p-doping, the Raman lines assigned to the bipyridine ring vibrations selectively attenuate for the p-doping only. The explanation is based on erasing the resonance enhancement in a doped supramolecular assembly. Whereas the charge transfer localized on the Van Hove singularities is generally amphoteric, the charge transfer localized on the Ru(II)-bipyridine complex is not. The p-doping of the Z-907Na/SWNT assembly at potentials positive to about 0.6 V versus a Ag pseudoreference causes faradaic oxidation of Ru(H) to Ru(III), but there is no mirror effect [reduction of Ru(II)] upon n-doping at the used potentials. Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidation manifests itself by selective bleaching of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition (from the t(2g)d orbitals at Ru(II) to the pi* orbitals at bipyridine), which is also involved in the Raman resonance enhancement. To address various tube-related transitions (E-11, E-22, and E-33), this effect was demonstrated for supramolecular assemblies made from two kinds of nanotubes, namely, CoMoCat and those grown from laser ablation.},

Nonlinear I-V characteristics set in at high bias and a negative differential resistance region is observed for the doped tubes. These behaviors can be well understood from the alignment/mis-alignment of the current carrying bands in the nanotube leads due to the applied bias voltage.

The reorganization energies between the neutral molecules and the corresponding monoanions for cyanodienes are larger than those for acenes with D-2h geometry. This result implies that the negatively charged cyanodienes would not be better conductors with slow electron transfer than the negatively charged acenes if we assume that the overlap of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) between cyanodienes is not significantly different from that between two neighboring acenes. The structures of the monoanions of cyanodienes are optimized under D-2h geometry, and the vibronic interaction effects in the monoanions of cyanodienes are discussed. The vibration effect on the charge-transfer problem is also discussed. The C-C and C-N stretching A, modes around 1000-1500 cm(-1) are the main modes converting the neutral structures to the monoanions in cyanodienes. This can be confirmed from the calculational results that the C-C and C-N stretching A(g) modes around 1000-1500 cm(-1) strongly couple to the LUMO in cyanodienes. The total electron-phonon coupling constants (l(LUMO)) for the monoanions of cyanodienes are estimated to be larger than those for the monoanions of acenes. The orbital patterns difference between the LUMO localized on carbon atoms located at the edge part of the carbon framework in acenes and the delocalized LUMO in cyanodienes due to electronegativity perturbation is the main reason that the l(LUMO) values for polycyanodienes are much larger than those for polyacenes. The relationships between the electron transfer and the electron-phonon interactions are discussed. The plot of the reorganization energies against the l(LUMO) values is found to be nearly linear.

Raman spectroscopy of the pristine polymer revealed a strong line at about 1520 cm(-1) and doublet structure at around 1560 cm(-1) in the C=C stretching region. By changing the exciting laser line these lines exhibit a dispersion which is about 16 cm(-1)/eV for the line at 1520 cm(-1). Substitution at the 2,3-positions with alkyl groups has only a weak influence on the vibrational properties. Several modes shift moderately toward lower frequencies with increasing chain length. the utilization of thiophene rings as substituents results in a much more efficient mode softening. in addition, the Raman response of FeCl3-doped samples is presented. Changes in relative intensities and weak line shifts were observed. Calculations on the ground state revealed that the quinonoid structure is by about 13 kcal/mol per repeat unit more stable than the aromatic form. By using the scaled quantum mechanical oligomer force field (SQMOFF) method the Raman spectrum of the quinonoid form was calculated. According to this the lines observed experimentally in the C=C stretching mode region originate from the inter-ring A(g) vibration and from an A(g) mode which mainly comprises intra-ring stretches superposed with a B-2g mode. the vibrational results are consistent with the calculated quinonoid ground-state geometry.},

By varying nitrogen partial pressure of the gas mixture in the range of 0 to 55.6\%, up to 23 at.\% of nitrogen was incorporated in amorphous diamond. The electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, Raman, and atomic force microscopy measurements indicated that most nitrogen atoms replaced carbon atoms in the amorphous structure. The electron concentration, mobility, and its resistivity were determined by the measurement of Hall effect. With the increasing of nitrogen content, the resistivity curve is U-shaped with a local minimum. The electron emission current in vacuum was characterized based on the diode design. It was found that the electron emission was highly reproducible. This is in contrast to the high variability observed for carbon nanotubes. The lowest resistivity coating had the lowest “turn-on” electrical field of 0.7 V/mum at the current density of 10 muA/cm(2).},

The formation of defects was followed by Raman spectroscopy that showed D band intensity coming from the defective part and no D band intensity coming from the original part of the same nanotube. It is shown that the presence of defects also reduces the intensity of the symmetry-allowed Raman features. Furthermore, the changes to the Raman resonance window upon the introduction of defects are analyzed. It is demonstrated that defects lead to both a broadening of the Raman resonance profile and a decrease in the maximum intensity of the resonance profile. The in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical data show a doping dependence of the Raman features taken from the defective part of the tested SWCNT.},

For zigzag tubes with small diameters, more electron conduction occurs through the outer O shell with longer Al-O bonds while the whole tube wall contributes to electron conduction for large diameter tubes or armchair tubes, which have similar inner and outer Al-O bond lengths. Lithium doping inside the tube cavity can stabilize the tubular form of AlO2 aluminates with metallic conduction, and these nanotubes eventually become semiconducting when heavily doped. On the other hand, although the formation of AlO nanotubes is difficult with Li doping, the tubular structure can be stabilized by hole doping.},

Special attention has been paid to the development of the tangential (TG) mode frequency, which shifts when the externally applied potential V-e is shifted away from V-e = 0. The magnitude and direction (upshift or downshift) of the tangential mode band has been found to be dependent on the diameter of the semiconducting tubes. For negative charging, the small-diameter tubes exhibit a downshift while the large-diameter tubes exhibit an upshift. This behavior is explained by a competition between two effects which cause opposite shifts in the TG mode frequency during negative charging: a phonon renormalization effect and a C-C bond weakening during the charging process. Positive charging always causes an upshift of the TG mode frequency. However, the magnitude of the upshift is dependent on the tube diameter.},

  abstract = {It has been well known that vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be grown by thermal CVD in NH3 environment. However, the mechanism of the vertically aligned CNT growth is yet to be clarified. In the present work, we investigated the effect of NH3 gas on the CNT growth in the viewpoint of catalyst passivation. The particles of Ni or Co of diameter ranging from 17 to 58 nm were used as the catalyst. CNTs were deposited at 950������C using C2H2 in various environments of NH3, H2, or their mixtures. In H2 environment, significant catalyst passivation was observed at the C2H2 concentration of 2.4 vol.\% due to the excessive supply of carbon. However, vertically aligned CNTs were deposited in NH3 environment even when the C2H2 concentration was 16.7 vol.\%. From the composition analysis of the catalyst surface, we could show that activated nitrogen atoms were generated by the decomposition of NH3. Two possible roles of the nitrogen were suggested based on the bamboo growth model. The nitrogen atoms enhance the formation of graphitic layer and/or improve the separation kinetics of the graphitic layer from the catalyst. The growth behaviors without the pre-treatment for 1 h in NH3 environment showed that the role of the nitrogen appeared in different ways depending on the catalyst materials. In the case of Co catalyst, where vertically aligned CNT growth was observed without the pre-treatment, enhanced formation of the graphitic layer might be the significant role of the nitrogen. However, when using Ni catalyst, the pre-treatment in NH3 environment was required for the CNT growth, which implies that both the formation and the separation of the graphitic layer were essential.},

The results of cyclic voltammetry indicated that the CNx nanotube modified electrodes with a high content of nitrogen exhibited higher electrocatalytic activities for the AA, the modified electrodes with a low content of nitrogen, however, showed the favorable electrocatalytic activity for DA. Additionally, the modified electrodes showed a linear response to DA in the concentration range of 5.0 X 10(-6)similar to 2.0 X 10(-4) mol/L and AA in the concentration range of 3.0 X 10(-5) similar to 1.0 X 10(-2) mol/L.

Carbon isotope distribution studies indicate that the anode deposit, like the cathode deposit, is depleted in C-13, demonstrating that it is derived from small C-a(-) (n{\textless}3) species. Materials formed under He/N-2 atmospheres contain small amounts of nitrogen. This incorporation of nitrogen into carbon products provide further evidence for small precursor species to these materials.

Centimeter-scale arrays containing thousands of single silicon nanowire field-effect transistors were fabricated in this way and were shown to exhibit both high performance with unprecedented reproducibility and scalability to at least the 100-nm level. Moreover, scalable device characteristics were demonstrated by interconnecting a controlled number of nanowires per transistor in `pixel-like' device arrays. The general applicability of this approach to other nanowire and nanotube building blocks could enable the assembly, interconnection, and integration of a broad range of functional nanosystems.},

  abstract = {Ferritin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins are chemically bonded to nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNx MWNTs) through a two-step process of diimide-activated amidation. First, carboxylated CNx MWNTs were activated by N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDAC), forming a stable active ester in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS). Second, the active ester was reacted with the amine groups on the proteins of ferritin or BSA, forming an amide bond between the CNx MWNTs and proteins. This two-step process avoids the intermolecular conjugation of proteins, and guarantees the uniform attachment of proteins on carbon nanotubes. TEM and AFM measurements clearly confirmed the successful attachment. This approach provides a universal and efficient method to attach biomolecules to carbon nanotubes at ambient conditions.},

The high degree of surface reduction was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopies.

We considered in the simulation two limiting cases; one where only a short portion of the tube is irradiated and the other where the whole tube is affected by the laser pulse. We have analyzed the role of chirality (zigzag versus armchair and some chiral tube cases) in the damage threshold as a function of tube diameter. Nontrivial dependence of the damage threshold as a function of diameter has been found. We find that for equal laser parameters, zigzag SWNTs are on average equally stable with respect to laser excitation as armchair SWNTs, but their stabilities show different dependencies on diameter. Due to the higher stiffness of the (n,n) tubes in the direction perpendicular to its axis as compared to the (n,0) tubes, we find the formation of standing waves in the nanotube wall for zigzag and not for armchair tubes. We also studied the role of the laser pulse duration and show that in general longer laser pulses increase the damage threshold. This result is rationalized in terms of electron-ion relaxation times. Implications of laser-induced structural transformations are analyzed.},

The boron-doped MWNTs were grown by a novel CVD process using a methanol solution of boric acid as a source material. In order to evaluate the transport property accurately, the electrical conductivity of each individual MWNT was measured by a four-point method. Nano-sized four electrodes with a width of several hundred nanometers were fabricated on an individual MWNT using electron beam (EB) lithography. The conductivity of a boron-doped MWNT was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of a non-doped MWNT at room temperature. Furthermore, the boron-doped MANT was found to maintain a high conductivity at a very low temperature of 0.6 K, while the non-doped MANT became an insulator. The electrical conductivity of the MWNTs was increased by boron doping. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

  abstract = {The electronic transport properties of conventional three-dimensional metals are successfully described by Fermi-liquid theory. But when the dimensionality of such a system is reduced to one, the Fermi-liquid state becomes unstable to Coulomb interactions, and the conduction electrons should instead behave according to Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) theory. Such a state reveals itself through interaction-dependent anomalous exponents in the correlation functions, density of states and momentum distribution of the electrons(1-3). Metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are considered to be ideal one-dimensional systems for realizing TLL states(4-6). Indeed, the results of transport measurements on metal - SWNT and SWNT - SWNT junctions have been attributed(7-9) to the effects of tunnelling into or between TLLs, although there remains some ambiguity in these interpretations(10). Direct observations of the electronic states in SWNTs are therefore needed to resolve these uncertainties. Here we report angle-integrated photoemission measurements of SWNTs. Our results reveal an oscillation in the pi-electron density of states owing to one-dimensional van Hove singularities, confirming the one-dimensional nature of the valence band. The spectral function and intensities at the Fermi level both exhibit power-law behaviour ( with almost identical exponents) in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the TLL state in SWNTs.},

Furthermore, the SWNTs from SiO2 has a much narrower size distribution. This may open a way to control the diameter of the SWNTs. More importantly, our work has found a series of oxides including Al2O3, TiO2, and rare earth oxides to be active for SWNT growth as well. These findings not only provide an alternative new type of catalysts for the growth of SWNTs but also give more insight into the role of the catalysts and a deeper understanding of the growth mechanism of SWNTs. The effective catalysts and catalytic activity for SWNT growth seem to be more size-dependent than the catalysts. Long oriented SWNTs generated from these catalysts enable us to rule out the relationship between the catalysts and the structures of the SWNTs. Thus controlled growth of SWNTs including the diameter and chirality is expected to be eventually realized.},

From the tunneling spectra with high-energy resolution obtained at 77 K, both metallic and semiconducting SWNTs were found in the same bundle. For the metallic SWNT, the conductance curve inside the first peak is finite and quite flat. The width between the first peaks is obtained as 1300 meV. Fine structures due to the anisotropy of equi-energy contours around the K point were observed just outside the first peaks. The observed gap width for the semiconducting SWNT is 600 meV. The conductance curve, which has broad peaks around V = + 80 mV was also observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Multi - walled carbon nanotubes with diameters of 20 similar to 30nm were synthesized by cobalt - catalytic decomposition of acetylene, which are showed by TEM images. A series of pretreatments including purification, annealing and doping were performed before carrying out hydrogen storage experiments at room temperature and modest pressure ( 12 MPa). For comparison, the annealing treatments were processed under ambient pressure in air and nitrogen atmosphere respectively. KNO3 solutions (0.1 mol/L and 1.0 mol/L) were used to dope carbon nanotubes. The results suggest that both annealing and doping play an important role in the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon nanotubes. Under the same conditions conducted, MWNTs annealed in nitrogen adsorbed more hydrogen than those annealed in air. FTIR spectra of the samples shows that the amount of oxygen functional groups linked to MWNTs after annealed in air is more than that treated in nitrogen. The former treatment may bring about more agglomeration of MWNTs, decrease the specific area and surface activity of MWNTs and eventually lead to lower capacity of hydrogen adsorption. The results also show that with the same dopant, the capacity of hydrogen adsorption has great difference when the concentration of the doping solution changed. Hydrogen adsorption of MWNTs increased not only after doped in KNO3 solution but also with the increase of solution concentration in certain extent. An optimal result(3.2\%) was obtained when carbon nanotubes were annealed in nitrogen at 500 degreesC and doped in 1.0 mol/L KNO3 solution. Hydrogen desorption experiments were also carried out at room temperature. It is found that after a typical adsorption/desorption cycle under ambient. temperature, the MWNTs samples still retain significant amount of stored hydrogen. The phenomenon may be attributed to the existence of two types of adsorbed hydrogen in the structure: physical and chemical adsorptions, the former can be released easily and the latter is strongly bound and could be released more difficultly.},

Here, we report the accidental discovery of a 2D silica glass supported on graphene. The 2D nature of this material enables the first atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy of a glass, producing images that strikingly resemble Zachariasen?s original 1932 cartoon models of 2D continuous random network glasses. Atomic-resolution electron spectroscopy identifies the glass as SiO2 formed from a bilayer of (SiO4)2? tetrahedra and without detectable covalent bonding to the graphene. From these images, we directly obtain ring statistics and pair distribution functions that span short-, medium-, and long-range order. Ab initio calculations indicate that van der Waals interactions with graphene energetically stabilizes the 2D structure with respect to bulk SiO2. These results demonstrate a new class of 2D glasses that can be applied in layered graphene devices and studied at the atomic scale.},

Upon illumination, the reversible capacity for the MWNTs reaches about 270 mAh g(-1) at the initial cycle, and remains above 250 mAh g(-1) after 25 cycles. The results from CV and EIS analysis reveal that the light irradiation on the MWNTs may allow easy insertion/extraction of lithium into/from the nanotubes, and therefore leading to higher reversible capacity than that without light irradiation.

In addition, the nanodiode demonstrated as a half-wave rectifier worked at an input sine wave of 1 kHz. Two CNx/C junctions were configured together to exhibit functions of OR and AND logic gates. Moreover, after substituting the wave-detection silicon diode in common transistor radio set with our nanodiode, the radio set still worked normally, representing an important step toward the potential application for nano-scale devices.

As a result, we predict that Sc3N@C-68 can be doped substitutionally with a boron atom much better than C-60. This effect can be ascribed to the favorable electrostatic attraction between the encased Sc3N cluster and the polar C-B bonds of the fullerene cage, which show the important role played by the encapsulated atoms in stabilizing the fullerene. A difference in the interaction also determines the regiospecificity of Sc3N@C67B. On the contrary, N-doping of the fullerenes forming Sc3N@C67N is much less favorable than that in C-60 or C-70. A judicious choice of stable isomers of Sc3N@C66BN among a vast number of possible isomers indicates that Sc3N@C-68 can also be doped with a pair of B and N atoms better than C-60 under the simultaneous existence of B and N sources. Relative stabilities of various isomers of the BN-substituted fullerenes can be understood in terms of the combined electrostatic effects in the B- and N-substitutions of Sc3N@C-68 complemented by a specific local preference in the N-substitution and the formation of a B-N bond.},

As in the case of the substitution in Sc3N@C-68, the feasibility of the B-substitution can be explained in terms of the electrostatic stabilization alone. However, we find that the BN-substitution is governed by a local preference complemented by the electrostatic effects. We also find that those substitutions restrict the rotation of the Sc3N cluster inside the cages to a certain degree, which is clearly different from the case of free rotation of the cluster in the undoped cage.

A film of pore diam 400 nm and pore depth 3 mum exhibited a 400-fold increase in the capacitance (3.91 x 10(3) F cm(-2)) in comparison to an as-deposited surface film. A film with 30 nm diam pores showed little enhancement in the capacitance at useful frequencies due to the high pore impedance. Impedance measurements carried out at -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl indicated a faradaic reaction. most likely hydrogen evolution. Although the dc current was small (ca. 3.0 muA cm(-2) real area for the 60 nm honeycomb), it represents a pathway for charge leakage, limiting the negative potential limit for charge storage. However. similar limits were also observed for a representative acetylene black and activated carbon. The as-deposited diamond and 60 x 500 nm honeycomb exhibited significantly higher effective potential limits for anodic charging due to the lack of surface oxidation current. This allows more charge to be stored per unit capacitance for diamond materials than for graphitic carbons. Due to the surface damage. the honeycomb sample did not store as much charge per unit capacitance as the as-deposited sample. (C) 2001 The Electrochemical Society.},

The relative ratios of armchair, zigzag, and reconstructed zigzag edges from over 350 frames at each temperature are measured. Below 400 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, the edges are dominated by zigzag terminations, but above 600 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, this changes dramatically, with edges dominated by armchair and reconstructed zigzag edges. We show that at low temperature chemical etching effects dominate and cause deviation to the thermodynamics of the system. At high temperatures (600 and 800 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C), adsorbates are evaporated from the surface of graphene and chemical etching effects are significantly reduced, enabling the thermodynamic distribution of edge types to be observed. The growth rate of holes at high temperature is also shown to be slower than at room temperature, indicative of the reduced chemical etching process. These results provide important insights into the role of chemical etching effects in the hole formation, edge sputtering, and edge reconstruction in graphene.},

In situ transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that this variation leads to differences in both morphology and coarsening behavior of the nanoparticles that we used to nucleate nanotubes.

Tyansmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the obtained sample powder consisted of high purity nanohorn-aggregates. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of a pellet formed from the sample indicated a feature based on the three-dimensional variable-range hopping (3D-VRH) conduction. From the analyses of 3D-VRH, it was found that the electronic density of states near the Fermi-level, N(0), was enhanced due to the boron-doping, reaching an enhancement factor of similar to 1.7 x 10(3) compared with the N(0) of the un-doped nanohorns. Moreover, the magnitude of the electrical resistivity decreased as the boron concentration increased. The electrical resistivity of the un-doped nanohorns also decreased with heat-treatment, but the N(0) value did not change significantly. These facts suggest that the change in N(0) should be associated with the boron atoms that are substitutionally doped in the sp(2)-bonded carbon network. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cyanide formation has been followed by measuring the decrease of the atomic nitrogen and carbon coverages and the accompanied increase in the CN coverage in temperature-programmed SIMS experiments. The CN formation kinetics is described by a preexponential factor and an activation energy of 1011������������1 s-1 and 111 ������������ 10 kJ/mol, respectively. In the absence of surface hydrogen, CN groups are stable up to ���������������������700 K.

Coadsorption of large amounts of ethylene to 0.10 monolayer of Nads results in the desorption of almost all nitrogen in the form of HCN between 500 and 700 K.

The obtained data show that although the average pore radius of investigated mesoporous PPy films (17-19 angstrom) is practically independent of the dopant anion used, however the latter determines the total pore volume and specific surface area values in different PPy materials investigated. As the total pore volumes for PPy films doped with large amphiphilic anions show the smallest values, the corresponding values for PPy/small inorganic anions, are up to 2 times higher.

A Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was used to investigate the photocatalytic activity for removing MB from the liquid phase.

  abstract = {The reported `electro-catalysis' Of C-60-film-modified electrodes for the electrochemical oxidation of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanamide and salbutamol has been explored at boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon electrodes. Using both C-60-film-modified boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon as underlying electrode substrates no electro-catalytic response is observed using the target analytes but rather the C-60 serves to block the electrode surface. A common experimental protocol used by researchers in this field is to electrochemically pre-treat the C-60-film-modified electrode. The response of employing this electrochemical pre-treatment at both bare glassy carbon and boron-doped diamond electrodes using the target analytes reveals that no effect on the electrochemical responses obtained at the boron-doped diamond electrode whereas a slight but significant effect occurs on glassy carbon which is attributed to the likely introduction of surface oxygenated species. Consequently the previously reported `electro-catalysis' using C-60-film-modified electrode is not due to C-60 itself being catalytic, but rather that substrate activation through electrode pre-treatment is responsible for the observed `electro-catalysis' likely through the introduction of surface oxygenated species. This work clearly shows that substrate activation is an important parameter which researchers studying C-60-film-modified electrodes, especially in electro-analysis needs to be considered.(C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In air- saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, we observed a steady- state output potential of - 80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at - 0.22 volts, compared with - 85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at - 0.20 volts for a platinum- carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron- accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the NCNTs, provides a four- electron pathway for the ORR on VA- NCNTs with a superb performance.},

  abstract = {Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is the key material for achieving excellent long-term results in total joint arthroplasties. Despite the fact that there has been a substantial amount of research and development over the years, new aspects of this material are still controversial and the most recent innovations have had a variable reception regarding clinical use. Advancements in conventional UHMWPE in the 1990s (nitrogen atmosphere irradiation, barrier package) were further improved by introduction of first-generation crosslinked polyethylene, as seen both from laboratory findings and clinical results. However, while clinical data on first-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) showed reduced wear in the medium-term, academic and industrial research have helped to re. ne the material further, to overcome criticisms regarding residual oxidation and potential material fracture. Present concerns, although less nowadays, relate to the post-irradiation techniques used to stabilize the crosslinked polyethylene, namely annealing and remelting. Current topics of research interest include in vivo oxidation, second-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene, vitamin E doped or blended polyethylene, fracture mechanics, and consequences of wear. Some of these improvements derived from recent research are already available to the orthopedic community, and others will appear in the next few years. This review gives an overview of these topics, and the latest advancements are described in detail with a view to help the orthopedic surgeon make scientifically sound decisions when selecting material for total-joint implants. We conclude the review by affirming that today's state-of-the-art material is no longer conventional UHMWPE, but HXLPE.},

Specific manipulation with nanotube assemblies was found to be possible under applied electrical field: attachment of a tiny nanotube bundle to the W needle and extraction of a given nanotube fragment from an entangled complex bunch were achieved. The electrically-probed B/N-doped C nanotubes exhibited alternating B-rich and C-rich B-C-N domains within tubular layers, as revealed by elemental mapping during energy-filtered TEM (Omega filter). At room temperature the nanostructures displayed resistivity (rho) of similar to 1.8 x 10(-5) Omegam and linear I-V curves.

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the composition and structural analysis of the as-grown nanotubes. HRTEM revealed that nanotubes prepared at high temperature with low nitrogen content have high graphitization degree. XPS analysis indicated that N 1s signal was split into three peaks. The decomposition of monoethanolamine at reaction temperature produces ammonia which may provide an efficient route of higher nitrogen content on carbon nanotubes.

  abstract = {Nanotubular structures in the B-C-N ceramic system represent an intriguing alternative to conventional carbon nanotubes. Because of the ability to widely vary the chemical composition of nanotubes within the B-C-N ternary phase diagram and to change the stacking of C-rich or BN-rich tubular shells in multiwalled structures, a wide horizon opens up for tuning nanostructure electrical properties. Pure carbon nanotubes are metals or narrow-bandgap semiconductors, depending on the helicity and diameter, whereas those of BN are insulators With a similar to5.0 eV gap independent of these parameters. Thus, the relative B/C/N ratios and/or BN-rich and C-rich domain spatial arrangements, rather than tube helicity and diameter, are assumed to primarily determine the B-C-N nanotube electrical response. This characteristic is highly valuable for nanotechnology. while tube diameter and helicity are currently difficult to control, continuous doping of C with BN, or vice versa, proceeds relatively,easily due to the isostructural nature of layered C and BN materials. In this article, recent progress in the synthesis, microscopic analysis, and electrical property measurements of a variety of compound nanotubes in the ceramic B-C-N system is documented and discussed.},

Photoelectrochemical, SEM and XRD measurements show successful doping at a dose of 1 x 10(16) ions/cm(2), however the ion implantation process causes strong structural alterations. Amorphous tubes show a disintegration of the morphological integrity, while anatase tubes are `amorphized'.

  abstract = {We present a review of experimental and theoretical results on the nucleation and growth of single-walled nanotubes, with particular emphasis on the growth of nanotube bundles emerging from catalyst particles obtained from evaporation-based elaboration techniques. General results are first discussed. Experiments strongly suggest a root-growth process in which carbon, dissolved at high temperatures in catalytic particles, segregates at the surface at lower temperatures to form tube embryos and finally nanotubes through a nucleation and growth process. A theoretical analysis of the reasons carbon does not always form graphene sheets to wrap the particles suggests analogies with other surface or interface instabilities, in particular, with those found in epitaxial growth. In the second part, detailed experimental results for nickel-rare earth metal catalysts are presented. By using various electron microscopy techniques, it is shown that carbon and the rare earth metal co-segregate at the surface of the particle and form carbide platelets, providing nucleation sites for nanotubes growing in directions perpendicular to the surface. A simple theoretical model is then presented in which the role of the rare earth metal is just to transfer electrons from metal to carbon. The graphene sheet is shown to become unstable; pentagons and heptagons are favored, which can explain the occurrence of local curvatures and of tube embryos. Finally, a brief discussion of some recent atomistic models is given.},

  abstract = {Carbon electrodes are widely used in electrochemistry due to their low cost, wide potential window, and low and stable background noise. Carbon-fiber electrodes (CFE) are commonly used to electrochemically measure “quantal” catecholamine release via exocytosis from individual cells, but it is difficult to integrate CFEs into lab-on-a-chip devices. Here we report the development of nitrogen doped diamond-like carbon (DLC:N) microelectrodes on a chip to monitor quantal release of catecholamines from cells. Advantages of DLC:N microelectrodes are that they are batch producible at low cost, and are harder and more durable than graphite films. The DLC:N microelectrodes were prepared by a magnetron sputtering process with nitrogen doping. The 30 mu m by 40 mu m DLC:N microelectrodes were patterned onto microscope glass slides by photolithography and lift-off technology. The properties of the DLC:N microelectrodes were characterized by AFM, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Quantal catecholamine release was recorded amperometrically from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells on the DLC:N microelectrodes. Amperometric spikes due to quantal release of catecholamines were similar in amplitude and area as those recorded using CFEs and the background current and noise levels of microchip DLC:N electrodes were also comparable to CFEs. Therefore, DLC:N microelectrodes are suitable for microchip-based high-throughput measurement of quantal exocytosis with applications in basic research, drug discovery and cell-based biosensors.},

  abstract = {The work function of palladium is known to be sensitive to hydrogen by the formation of a surface dipole layer or Pd hydride. One approach to detect such a change in the work function can be based on the formation of a Schottky barrier between the palladium metal and a semiconductor. Here, we study the hydrogen sensitivity of Schottky barrier field-effect transistors made for the first time from diameter- and chirality-sorted semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) in contact with Pd electrodes. We observe an unrivaled 100-fold change in the on-state conductance at 100 ppm H2 compared to air for devices with s-SWNT and diameters between 1 and 1.6 nm. Hydrogen sensing is not observed for devices of Pd-contacted few-layer graphene (FLG), as expected due to the absence of a significant Schottky barrier. Unexpectedly, we observe also a vanishing sensitivity for small-diameter SWNTs. We explain this observation by changes in the nanotube work function caused by spillover and chemisorption of atomic hydrogen onto small-diameter nanotubes. We also observe that long-term sensing stability is only achieved if the gate voltage is inverted periodically. Under constant gate bias, the sensitivity reduces with time, which we relate to gate screening by accumulated charges in the substrate.},

As the cutting speed is related to the migration of displaced carbon atoms trapped inside the tube and to their recombination with vacancies, we obtain information about the mobility of the trapped atoms and estimate their migration barrier to be about 0.25 eV. This is an experimental confirmation of the remarkably high mobility of interstitial atoms inside carbon nanotubes, which shows that nanotubes have potential applications as pipelines for the transport of carbon atoms.},

These armchair tubes are semiconductors with much smaller band gaps than those of corresponding silicon carbide nanotubes, and the gap decreases with the tube diameter.

Nevertheless, it is essential to overcome some problems that stop this technology coming into business. In particular, one of the main obstacle to the commercial development of PEMFCs is the need to use platinum as active phase at electrodes to increase the reaction rate and this implies a considerable rice in the price. In this study, to get round this problem, we have proposed a more efficient catalytic layer configuration, based on Pt nanoclusters (Ptnano) supported onto carbon black or carbon nanotubes (CNT), allowing a significant improvement of the electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen oxidation at the anode. Moreover, if traces of CO are present in the feed, cell efficiency decays strongly so these Ptnano/C systems were also investigated against CO poisoning.},

High resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the nitrogen-doped MWNT fracture specimens showed the presence of regions of reduced cross-section areas and kinks in close proximity to the fracture surfaces.

Targets with low B concentration (below 3 at\%), produced ropes of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with no detectable boron present in the SWCNT ropes. However, unintended N-doping of the curved honeycomb lattice was observed in the 2.5 at\% B sample (which is attributed to the possible presence of small amounts of N in the targets or reaction environments), with striking consequences for doping of heteroatoms within the hexagonal lattice of the graphene layer. At higher B concentration (3.5 at\% and higher), there are significant changes in the nanostructure, which exhibits defective graphite layers and a small number of double wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs).

After carbonization of polypyrrole at 800 degrees C and etching of the silica templates with hydrofluoric acid solution, nitrogen-doped and graphitic OMCs with incorporated magnetic nanoparticles were obtained. These materials were analyzed by CHNS elemental analysis, thermogravimetry (TG), nitrogen adsorption, small and wide angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resulting carbon replicas retained the crystallographic symmetry of the silica templates: namely, P6mm in the case of the SBA-15 template, and Im3m in the case of the SBA-16 template. The uniformity, size, and volume of ordered mesopores in the carbon replicas were affected by structural properties of the templates used as shown by analysis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions. A better infiltration of carbon precursor was achieved for the templates with larger pores, which resulted in the carbon replicas of improved adsorption and structural properties. Elemental analysis revealed the presence of nitrogen in the carbon replicas studied in the range of 3-8 wt \%, whereas TG analysis of the replica samples in air gave about 2-5\% residue, which was identified as hematite (Fe2O3). The presence of graphitic domains was confirmed by characteristic TG oxidation profile above 400 degrees C, the D and G bands on the Raman spectra, and the intense reflections on the wide angle XRD patterns. Powder XRD also showed the presence of extra-framework magnetic iron (alpha-Fe) and iron carbide (Fe3C) nanoparticles having crystallite size in the ranges of 40-80 and 20-40 nm, respectively. TEM images also revealed that these nanoparticles were larger than the carbon rods and pore widths of the SBA-15 carbon replica, which is in good agreement with the XRD-based estimation. The in situ EDS analysis of carbon rods and spheres showed that iron was present in the carbonaceous framework, which does not exclude the existence of much smaller nanoparticles, below 5 nm.},

  abstract = {The influence of disorder and defects is of fundamental relevance in the performance of nanotube-based devices. It is then crucial to understand the properties of (as-grown or in situ created) defects in order to conquer their detrimental effects, but also to tune nanotube properties in a desired direction. We show experimentally and theoretically the formation, in different single-walled carbon nanotubes, of a strong Anderson localization regime in which the electrical resistance increases exponentially with the length of the nanotube. This implies that, in these systems, the coherence length can be much longer than the localization length. We also show how the localization length depends strongly on the tube diameter and it increases as the tube diameter is enlarged. Furthermore, we analyse in detail the role of temperature on electron localization, demonstrating that this strong localization regime survives to nearly room temperature: the net effect of the temperature is to wash out the strong fluctuations that appear at zero temperature.},

  volume = {134},
  abstract = {We present here the application of the energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) in the tomographic mode to determine the precise 3D distribution of nitrogen within nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). Several tilt series of energy-filtered images were acquired on the K ionization edges of carbon and nitrogen on a multiwalled N-CNT containing a high amount of nitrogen. Two tilt series of carbon and nitrogen 2D maps were then calculated from the corresponding energy-filtered images by using a proper extraction procedure of the chemical signals. Applying iterative reconstruction algorithms provided two spatially correlated C and N elemental-selective volumes, which were then simultaneously analyzed with the shape-sensitive reconstruction deduced from Zero-Loss recordings. With respect to the previous findings, crucial information obtained by analyzing the 3D chemical maps was that, among the two different kind of arches formed in these nanotubes (transversal or rounded ones depending on their morphology), the transversal arches contain more nitrogen than do the round ones. In addition, a detailed analysis of the shape-sensitive volume allowed the observation of an unexpected change in morphology along the tube axis: close to the round arches (with less N), the tube is roughly cylindrical, whereas near the transversal ones (with more N), its shape changes to a prism. This relatively new technique is very powerful in the material science because it combines the ability of the classical electron tomography to solve 3D structures and the chemical selectivity of the EFTEM imaging.},

Core-level electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals that the boron incorporates into the lattice structure of the tubes, transferring similar to1/2 hole per boron atom into the carbon derived unoccupied density of states. The charge transfer and the calculated Fermi-energy shift in the doped nanotubes evidence that a simple rigid-band model can be ruled out and that additional effects such as charge localization and doping induced band-structure changes play an important role at this high doping levels. In optical absorption a new peak appears at 0.4 eV which is independent of the doping level. Compared to the results from a series of ab initio calculations our results support the selective doping of semiconducting nanotubes and the formation of BC3 nanotubes instead of a homogeneous random boron substitution.},

  abstract = {An efficient approach to composite film fabrication that involves the control of doping processes between soluble multiwalled nanotubes (s-MWNTs) and polyaniline (PAN) molecules has been developed in this work. The s-MWNTs were prepared by introducing carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups to the surfaces of nanotubes. The s-MWNT was used as a dopant to react with the imine nitrogens of emeraldine PAN via the protonation doping process in a layer-by-layer manner. The resultant composite films on the quartz substrates were characterized by UV/Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron micrograph and X-ray diffraction. Results showed that s-MWNTs were doped into polyaniline layers, which caused changes in the composite film characteristics such as electrical properties, spectroscopic features and morphology. Unlike the already-used layer-by-layer process based on electrostatic attraction, our process is based on the acid-base reaction between emeraldine and s-MWNT. Owing to the protonation doping, the bond between the carboxyl group and the imine nitrogen group becomes covalent, which enhances the stability of the film.},

It is shown that the conductances are quite sensitive to the number of C-20 molecules between electrodes for both configuration CF1 and double-bonded models: the conductances of C-20 dimers are markedly smaller than those of monomers. The physics is that incident elections easily pass the C-20 molecules and are predominantly scattered at the C-20-C-20 junctions. Moreover, we study the doping effect of such molecular junction by doping nitrogen atoms substitutionally. The bonding property of the molecular junction with configuration CF1 has been analysed by calculating the Mulliken atomic charges. Our results have revealed that the C atoms in N-doped junctions are more ionic than those in pure-carbon ones, leading to the fact that N-doped junctions have relatively large conductance.},

  abstract = {Controversial experimental results have suggested that the presence of alkali metals in graphitic adsorbents would intensify hydrogen adsorption. Mainly by use of density functional theory methods, several authors have confirmed this intensification, which has been explained by a significant charge transfer from dopand, located on top of the center of a ring (the hollow configuration), to substrate. However, in this work, it was found that, for each distance of the hollow configuration of the Li-graphene interaction, depending on the initial guess, not only one but two qualitatively different self-consistent field solutions would be possible. One of them would concentrate charge in the region between lithium and graphene. The other one would be just the opposite. At fully correlated second-order Moller-Plesset level, for each distance, the latter was found to be significantly more stable than the former. So, it seems that the charge transfer from lithium to graphene described by several authors would not take place. The set of results reported here would provide evidence that solutions for the interaction of alkali metals with single-layer all-carbon materials would be extremely sensitive to initial guesses and correlation treatments. It is concluded that, in the case of alkali metal doping being capable of significantly intensifying physisorption of molecular hydrogen on single-layer all-carbon materials, the postulated charge transfer from dopand (located on top of the center of a ring) to substrate would not be the mechanism.},

This review will highlight recent advances in CVD precursor design, including both single-source and co-reactant precursor systems. Whereas the earliest examples of CVD precursors included metal beta-diketonates, this review will feature novel ligand systems that have already been used, or have been proposed for future MOCVD applications. In addition, we will describe new methodologies that have improved the deposition process through innovations in precursor delivery and decomposition within the CVD system.

  doi = {10.1088/0953-8984/22/25/253202},
  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn‚ÄìSham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange‚Äìcorrelation functionals, parallelization schemes, ØEîSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

Here, the structure, defects, and morphology of the nanotubes were analyzed in depth using advanced electron microscopy techniques, and compared with existing models and observations.

Remarkably, boron doping of unpassivated SWCNTs at both zigzag edges is found to favor a ferromagnetic ground state, with the B-doped tubes displaying half-metallic behavior even in the absence of an electric field. Aside of the intrinsic interest of these results, an important avenue for development of CNT-based spintronic is suggested. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation-depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to approx140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics. The reported performance of diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy opens up a pathway for addressing fundamental problems in the life sciences.},

The CNT-CC electrode provides a fast electron-transfer path to the carbon cloth, resulting in energy-loss reduction and enhancing catalytic activity of Pt NPs. The N-dopants in CNT serve as the defect sites to enhance nucleation of Pt particles. The reduction of the Pt precursor salt was carried out in the ethylene glycol solution at an elevated temperature. In order to control the Pt NP size, the pH of the reaction solution was controlled by the addition of NaOH. Zeta potential measurements of the as-prepared sample indicate that a higher zeta potential results in a smaller particle size, due to a stronger electrostatic repulsion between NPs. This serves a powerful tool for size control of the Pt nanoparticle. The Pt NPs dispersed on the CNT-CC have an average size of 2.81 nm (Pt/CNT-CC) prepared using 15 mM NaOH, with high uniformity under electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/CNT-CC for methanol oxidation indicate that it exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and are ideal for direct methanol fuel cell applications.

Consequently, its growth rate is shown to be proportional to the Burgers vector of such dislocation and therefore to the chiral angle of the tube.

Furthermore the effects of nitrogen content on the electrochemistry of CNx modified electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). CNx modified electrodes exhibit better electrocatalytic activities to the oxidation of hydroquinone. Moreover CNx with lower nitrogen content is in favor of the electron transfer between dihydroxybenzene and electrode surface, while CNx with higher nitrogen content possesses high surface adsorptive ability.

Nucleation of these carbon (C) structures can be divided into three stages:��������� (i) at short times the FeC particle is not saturated in C and all C atoms are dissolved in the particle; (ii) at intermediate times the FeC cluster is highly supersaturated in C and carbon strings, polygons and small graphitic islands nucleate on the cluster surface; (iii) at longer times the FeC cluster is supersaturated in C and, depending on the temperature, the graphene sheet, SWNT, or soot-like structure is grown. At low temperatures the kinetic energy is not sufficient to overcome the attractive forces between the particle and the graphitic islands (that are formed in stage ii) and, because these islands cannot lift off the particle, a complete graphene sheet grows around the cluster. At temperatures above 800 K the kinetic energy is sufficiently high to overcome these attractive forces so that the graphitic island lifts off the particle to form a cap. Between 800 and 1400 K theses caps grow into SWNTs, and at temperatures larger than 1600 K the large number of defects in the growing carbon structure produces a soot-like structure. The calculations also reveal that the growing SWNT maintains an open end on the cluster due to the strong bonding between the open nanotube end atoms and the cluster. The number of defects in the SWNT structure can be reduced by lowering the rate of carbon addition to the FeC cluster.},

  abstract = {Acetylene has been pyrolysed in a flow reactor system at 914-1039 K and 6-47 kPa, with residence times between 3 and 50 ms. Pressures at the reactor inlet were greater than those at the outlet because of viscous drag. This permitted calculation of the viscosity of acetylene, which was found to have a dependence on the absolute temperature proportional to T0.71+/-0.08. Expressions were developed to describe the yields of products in a compressible gas undergoing simultaneous viscous expansion and slow reaction. Yields of products were measured by gas chromatography. Vinylacetylene and benzene were found to be primary products, with orders of two and three, and activation energies of 208+/-13 and 164+/-17 kJ mol-1, respectively. Acetone, which occurs as an impurity in commercial acetylene, was found to accelerate the formation of both products by a factor between two and four. This provided evidence to support a free-radical mechanism with a second-order initiation step, whose activation energy is approximately in the range from 220 to 250 kJ mol-1. The chain length was estimated to be between 10 and 150, depending on the conditions and the identity of the termination step.},

  abstract = {Self-doped poly(anilineboronic acid) (PABA) nanostructures have been prepared by chemical polymerization in an aqueous acid solution and aliphatic alcohols. In aliphatic alcohols, PABA is soluble under the polymerization conditions. According to B-11 NMR studies, the formation of anionic tetrahedral boronate ester in aliphatic alcohols in the presence of fluoride forms the basis of self-doped, soluble PABA. Transmission electron microscope images show the formation of nanostructures with different shapes and forms in different solvents after precipitation of the polymer as a result of ion exchange in the presence of 0.5 m HCl The spectroscopic and cyclic voltammetric results confirm the formation of conducting PABA nanostructures in high yield. The conductivity of PABA thin films made from the nanostructures prepared in aqueous acid, methanol, ethanol and I-propanol is approximately 15 and 3.0, 2.1 and 1.9 S . cm(-1), respectively. The conducting PABA nanostructures are processable since they are easily re-dispersed in the various solvents up to approximately 5 mg . mL(-1). UV-vis kinetic measurements, XPS and B-11 NMR results suggest that the formation of various nanostructures is influenced by the polymerization rate, the degree of self-doping versus external doping, and the polarity of the solvents used. The PABA nanostructured films produced from these structures exhibit enhanced redox stability in a wider potential window in non-aqueous media compared to polyaniline due to formation of six-member heterocyclic complexes Containing a boron- imine dative bond resulting in a self-doped self-cross- linked polymer. The degree of cross-linking depends on the nature of nanostructures. In non-aqueous media, the self-doped, self-cross-linked PABA nanostructured films are much less susceptible to cathodic and anodic degradation at extreme potentials, overcoming a major limitation of more common conducting polymers.},

  abstract = {The internal and external adsorption of CH4 on zigzag pristine and N-doped SWCNTs has been investigated employing first principles calculations. Two different substitutions were performed to obtain pyridinic (N-py) and graphitic (N-sp3) nitrogen. The adsorption of CH4 inside SWCNTs is expected to be more favorable than on groove sites for open-ended small diameter (0.7-1.1 nm) pure SWCNTs. In general, the introduction of N atoms increases the external adsorption energies (E-ads). In the case of N-py-doped SWCNTs, they are increased over a 100\%. However, for the internal adsorption, the E-ads can be decreased or increased when N atoms are included. For the N-sp3-doped (9,0) SWCNT, it is decreased with respect to the undoped tube. Thus, the optimal radius to encapsulate CH4 is increased upon N-doping. The adsorption isotherms of CH4 are going to be dependent on the production method of the SWCNTs, if they have open ends; this fact is in contrast with the experimental measurements on close-ended SWCNT. For undoped SWCNTs, the encapsulation inside small diameter (0.7-1.1 nm) SWCNT is going to be preferred over electric arc-SWCNTs (1.4-1.8 nm diameter). However, for N-doped SWCNTs, the opposite should be true, if enough nitrogen is introduced. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The molecular dynamics study performed here shows that the CG is more important than the TG for the growth of SWNTs on small metal particles and that SWNTs growth can, in fact, even occur in the presence of an opposing TG (i.e., the SWNTs grow from the hot region of the catalyst particle).

At 1173���������K the hydrogen cyanide production rate depends on the order of introducing the reactants. HCN is formed rapidly on the methane pulse just after introducing ammonia. However, a slow formation of HCN is observed on the ammonia pulse that follows a methane pulse. Moreover the form of the HCN response resembles closely that of the nitrogen and hydrogen also released during the ammonia pulse. Thus, the rate-determining step for the formation of HCN is the decomposition rate of ammonia. A reaction sequence based on elementary steps is proposed for the HCN synthesis. The formation of HCN after pulsing H2 points to a pool of surface intermediate species that are hydrogenated to HCN.},

The production method involves the immobilization of initiators, using wet chemistry, onto the nanotube surface, followed by an in situ surface-initiated polymerization. The polymer-grafting carbon nanotubes synthesis includes the free radical functionalization of CNx and the “controlled/living” Nitroxide Mediated Radical Polymerization (NMRP). The obtained products were studied using several microscopic techniques as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The characterization also includes the rmog ravi metric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), among others. The analyzed samples were also compared with solutions fabricated by physical blending of the polymer and CNx nanotubes. These results indicate that the nanotube radical functionalization, the chemical grafting, and the polymerization reaction were obtained over CNx when NMRP method was successfully used, giving rise to a uniform PS layer of several nanometers grafted on the outer surface of the CNx nanotubes. Several properties of the PS-grafted CNx nanotubes were also studied. It is shown that the production method leads to a narrower distribution of the external diameters. Moreover, their solubilization in organic solvents is greatly improved. Finally, the dispersion of PS-grafted CN, into a PS matrix is studied to determine the differences in filler dispersion and interfacial adhesion strength, in comparison with nanocomposites elaborated with as-produced CNx.},

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM) and Raman spectroscopy have been used to characterize the modified-electrode morphology and microstructure, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been used to study the electrochemical performances, with seven different redox systems serving as probes (Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-); Ru(NH3)(6)(3+/2+), Ir(Cl)(6)(2-/3-), catechol, dopamine, ferrocene monocarboxylic acid and caffeic acid). The analytical response for different systems is highly reproducible for each type of tungsten microelectrode modified with SWCNT coating by Chemical Vapor Deposition method (CVD). For all seven redox systems, the forward reaction peak current varies linearly with the square root of scan rate (v)(1/2), indicative of electrode reaction kinetics controlled by mass transport (semi-infinite linear diffusion) of the reactant. Apparent heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants, K degrees(app), for all seven redox systems have been determined from Delta E-P-v experimental data, according to the method described by Nicholson. K degrees(app) values of 1.02-1.17 cm/s have been observed for Ru(NH3)(6)(3+/2+), Ir(CI)(6)(2-/3-), and Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) without any extensive electrode pretreatment (e.g., polishing). Lower K degrees(app) values of 10(-6)-10(-2) cm/s have been found for catechol, dopamine, ferrocene monocarboxylic acid, and caffeic acid. The voltammetric responses for Ru(NH3)(6)(3+/2+), Ir(CI)(6)(2-/3), and Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) have also been examined at SWCNT-modified W electrodes in different solutions pH (1.1-10.0), and the corresponding Delta E-p, i(p)(ox); i(p)(red); and K degrees(app), values for the most part, have been unaffected by the solution pH. This is probably related to the absence of oxygen-functionalities at SWCNT-modified W microelectrodes, which is in contrast to the typical behavior of the oxygenated, sp(2) carbon electrodes, such as glassy carbon or graphite.},

Estimates of the carrier mobility made from gate-dependent transport measurements are consistent with diffusive transport. In addition, these studies show it is possible to heavily dope SiNWs and approach a metallic regime. Temperature-dependent measurements made on heavily doped SiNWs show no evidence for Coulomb blockade at temperatures down to 4.2 K, and thus testify to the structural and electronic uniformity of the SiNWs. Potential applications of the doped SiNWs are discussed.},

Active bipolar transistors, consisting of heavily and lightly n-doped nanowires crossing a common p-type wire base, exhibit common base and emitter current gains as Large as 0.94 and 16, respectively. In addition, p- and n-type nanowires have been used to assemble complementary inverter-like structures.

  volume = {21},
  issn = {0953-2048},
  abstract = {The magnetic and transport properties of MgB2 films present performance goals yet to be attained for powder-processed bulk samples and conductors. Carbon-doped films have exhibited upper critical fields, mu H-0(c2), as high as 60 T and a possible upper limit of more than twice this value has been predicted. Very high critical current densities, J(c), have also been measured for films, e.g. 25 MA cm(-2) in the self-field and 7 kA cm(-2) in 15 T. Such performance limits are still out of reach for even the best MgB2 magnet wire. In discussing the present status and prospects for improving the performance of powder-based wire we focus attention on (1) the intrinsic (intragrain) superconducting properties of MgB2-H-c2 and flux pinning, and (2) the factors that control the efficiency with which current is transported from grain to grain in the conductor, an extrinsic (intergrain) property. With regard to item (1), the role of dopants in H-c2 enhancement is discussed and examples presented. On the other hand their roles in increasing J(c), both via H-c2 enhancement as well as via direct fluxoid/pinning center interaction, are discussed and a comprehensive survey of H-c2 dopants and flux pinning additives is presented. Dopant selection, chemistry, methods of introduction (inclusion), and homogeneity of distribution (via the rounding of the superconducting electronic specific heat transition) are considered. Current transport through the powder-processed wire (an extrinsic property) is partially blocked by the inherent granularity of the material itself and the chemical or other properties of the intergrain surfaces. Overall porosity, including reduced density and intergranular blocking, is quantified in terms of the measured temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity compared to that of a clean single crystal. Several experimental results are presented in terms of per cent effective cross-sectional area for current transport. These and other such results indicate that in many cases less than 15\% of the conductor's cross-sectional area is able to carry transport current. It is pointed out that densificationin association with the elimination of grain-boundary blocking phases would yield fivefold-to-tenfold increases in J(c) in relevant regimes, enabling the performance of MgB2 in selected applications to compete with that of Nb3Sn.},

The electrical resistance changes observed were substantial, with figures ranging from 42 to 182 k Omega, and are largely correlated with the extension of the contact area (electrode-nanotube or nanotube-nanotube). Despite the repeated deformation cycles and high bending angles achieved, the nanotubes kept their metallic nature throughout. In addition to this, it was noticed that the CNx nanotubes presented sections with several structural defects which acted as joints during their controlled bending. These areas represent high-resistive points which may lead to fatal structural failure, as demonstrated in the current induced failure experiments here reported.},

The paramagnetic impurities of undoped single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are characterized via EPR resulting in a broad superparamagnetic signal of the remaining catalyst particles and a rather narrow signal of carbonaceous material. Comparison of EPR spectra of several nitrogen endohedral doped peapods with their analogues obtained in a solid fullerene matrix shows a significant broadening of N@C-60 and N@C-70 EPR signals. This broadening is related to a non-vanishing zero-field splitting caused by deformation of the fullerene cage upon encapsulation.},

The phenanthrene/K complex in 1,2-dimethylethyl ether solution was used for the K-doping. Doping concentration of K in the DWCNTs was 3.2 at \%. The K 2p spectrum comprises two peak components at binding energies of K 2p(3/2) (293 eV) and K 2p(1/2) (296 eV), which can be ascribed to the K oxides and cations, respectively. This indicates that the K-doping exhibits a strong charge transfer interaction with carbon atoms and the oxygen atoms at the interface of K/phenanthrene and DWCNTs. Many defects were observed on the wall of the K-doped DWCNTs, resulting in rugged graphite sheets. Also, sometimes cutting appeared on the cross of graphite layers. It was found from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman analysis that the crystallinity of DWCNTs decreased due to K-doping. The room-temperature chemical K-doping strongly influenced the crystalline perfection and defect degree of DWCNTs. The K-doped DWCNTs showed the lower turn-on electric field and the higher emission current density compared to the undoped DWCNTs.},

We identified three typed N structures: graphite-like, pyridine-like, and molecular N-2. The pyridine-like N structure becomes significant at the inner walls. Molecular N would exist as intercalated forms in the vicinity of hollow inside. The XPS valence band analysis reveals that the pyridine-like N structure induces the metallic behaviors. The CNTs grown using NiPc contain the higher content of pyridine-like structure compared to those grown using FePc and Cope, so they exhibit more metallic properties.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were heated to 1000 degreesC under an ultrahigh vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) reveal three different N structures; graphitelike, pyridine-like, and molecular N-2. The vibrationally resolved XANES peaks of N-2 were first observed, suggesting the existence of molecular N-2 as intercalated and trapped forms. The annealing process can decrease the average N content from 6.3 at. \% to 3.3 at. \%, mainly by releasing molecular N-2. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirms that the annealing releases molecular N-2 from the CNTs.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N)-doped graphitic layers were uniformly synthesized as shells on pregrown Si nanowires by chemical vapor deposition. The N content (���������������������10 atomic \%) and thickness (���������������������50 nm) of the graphitic layers were finely controlled by adjusting the deposition conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that pyridine-like N structures become favorable as the N content increases. For maximum 10\% doping, pyridine-like N structures produced selectively at the highly curved graphitic layers of the thinner shell, whereas graphite-like N structures remain dominant at the less curved graphitic layers of the thicker shell. Raman spectroscopy supports the controlled and selective growth of these two N structures upon the change of the shell thickness and N content. The first principles calculation of the carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene suggests that, for the CNT isomers, the pyridine-like structures, which are characterized by divacancies around the doped N sites, become more favorable than the graphite-like ones at a higher doping level. The preference of the pyridine-like structures reduces at the graphene isomers, which strongly supports the experimental results.},

The electronic structures of BNNT and C-doped BNNT present dramatic changes after the adsorption of O-2, NO2 and F-2 molecules.

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {Graphene has been highlighted recently as a promising material for energy conversion due to its unique properties deriving from a two-dimensional layered structure of sp2-hybridized carbon. Herein, N-doped graphene (NGr) is developed for its application in oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in acidic media, and additional doping of B or P into the NGr is attempted to enhance the ORR performance. The NGr exhibits an onset potential of 0.84 V and a mass activity of 0.45 mA mg-1 at 0.75 V. However, the B, N- (BNGr) and P, N-doped graphene (PNGr) show onset potentials of 0.86 and 0.87 V, and mass activities of 0.53 and 0.80 mA mg-1, respectively, which are correspondingly 1.2 and 1.8 times higher than those of the NGr. Moreover, an additional doping of B or P effectively reduces the production of H2O2 in the ORRs, and shows much higher stability than that of Pt/C in acidic media. It is proposed that the improvement in the ORR activity results from the enhanced asymmetry of the spin density or electron transfer on the basal plane of the graphene, and the decrease in the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the graphene through additional doping of B or P.},

It has been found that the electrocatalytic activity of the BCNTs modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode toward the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide is much higher than that of the un-doped CNTs modified electrode due to the large amount of edge sites and oxygen-rich groups located at the defective sites induced by boron doping. Glucose oxidase (GOD) was selected as the model enzyme and immobilized on the BCNTs modified glassy carbon electrode by entrapping GOD into poly(o-aminophenol) film. The performance of the sensor was investigated by electrochemical methods. At an optimum potential of +0.60 V and pH 7.0, the biosensor exhibits good characteristics, such as high sensitivity (171.2 nA mM(-1)), low detection limit(3.6 mu M), short response time (within 6 s), satisfactory anti-interference ability and good stability.

The evolution was followed via changes observed in the scattering from the tangential (T) and radial (R) phonon modes. After the initial exposure to Cs vapor, a very long induction interval was observed, followed by three distinct intervals where different phonon mode behavior with doping could be identified. The second interval was marked by a strong decrease in the scattering intensity; the R band was observed to have a 2.5 cm(-1) upshift before its disappearance, while no apparent shift in the T band was observed. The third interval is marked by a continued loss in T band intensity, while the shoulders on the T band are gradually lost; the final T band shape in this interval is well described by a single broad Lorentzian. Also during the third interval, an anomalous upshift in the T band is observed (similar to4 cm(-1)). In the fourth, and final, interval, the Lorentzian T band first downshifts and then assumes an asymmetrically broadened Fano interference line shape. During the evolution of this Fano line shape, the renormalized phonon frequency continued to downshift. The results are discussed in terms of current theories for doping-induced changes in the C-C bond length of SWNTs.},

However, such an effect could not be found in Fe/C nanotubes. Microwave absorption properties of both Fe/CNx and Fe/C nanocomposites at 2-18 GHz band were studied.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were combined to resolve the binding configurations of nitrogen and carbon in the N-doped CNTs. In the XPS study, it may be concluded that the N-doped CNTs have three binding configuration types (poly 4-vinylpyridine, poly 9-vinylcarbazole, and poly aniline oligomer) using the method proposed by [F. L. Normand, J. Hommet, T. Szorenyi, C. Fuchs, and E. Fogarassy, Phys. Rev.

The suggested growth mechanism of the nanowires is vapor-solid growth, in which gaseous ammonia plays a significant role to reduce the formation temperature.

All the observation and analysis confirmed that the MWCNTs were filled with iron oxide. Field emission from these arrays of iron oxide-filled MWCNTs was measured and the turn-on field was determined to range from 0.83-1.01 V/mu m, appearing to be much lower than those of arrays of pure MWCNTs and arrays of nitrogen-doped MWCNTs fabricated in similar ways.

By tailoring the composition of reactants and reaction atmosphere, N-CNTs with nitrogen contents from 0\% to 4.36\% and P-CNTs with phosphorous contents from 0.55\% to 5.14\% were synthesized.

B-doping does not improve the activity of CNTs. The effect of the number of nitrogen functionalities and defects was investigated to reveal the structure���activity relationship of the doped CNTs.

  title = {Kohn anomalies and nonadiabaticity in doped carbon nanotubes},
  volume = {75},
  abstract = {The high-frequency Raman-active phonon modes of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are thought to be characterized by Kohn anomalies (KAs) resulting from the combination of SWCNT intrinsic one-dimensional nature and a significant electron-phonon coupling (EPC). KAs are expected to be modified by the doping-induced tuning of the Fermi energy level epsilon(F), obtained through the intercalation of SWCNTs with alkali atoms or by the application of a gate potential. We present a density-functional theory (DFT) study of the phonon properties of a (9,9) metallic SWCNT as a function of electronic doping. For such study, we use, as in standard DFT calculations of vibrational properties, the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. We also develop an analytical model capable of reproducing and interpreting our DFT results. Both DFT calculations and this model predict, for increasing doping levels, a series of EPC-induced KAs in the vibrational mode parallel to the tube axis at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone, usually indicated in Raman spectroscopy as the G(-) peak. Such KAs would arise each time a new conduction band is populated. However, we show that they are an artifact of the BO approximation. The inclusion of nonadiabatic effects dramatically affects the results, predicting KAs at Gamma only when epsilon(F) is close to a band crossing E-X. For each band crossing, a double KA occurs for epsilon(F)=E-X +/- h omega/2, where h omega is the phonon energy. In particular, for a 1.2 nm metallic nanotube, we predict a KA to occur in the so-called G(-) peak at a doping level of about N-el/C=+/- 0.0015 atom (epsilon(F)approximate to +/- 0.1 eV) and, possibly, close to the saturation doping level (N-el/C similar to 0.125), where an interlayer band crosses the pi(*) nanotube bands. Furthermore, we predict that the Raman linewidth of the G(-) peak significantly decreases for parallel to epsilon(F)parallel to {\textgreater}= h omega/2. Thus, our results provide a tool to determine experimentally the doping level from the value of the KA-induced frequency shift and from the linewidth of the G(-) peak. Finally, we predict KAs to occur in phonons with finite momentum q not only in proximity of a band crossing but also each time a new band is populated. Such KAs should be observable in the double-resonant Raman peaks, such as the defect-activated D peak, and the second-order peaks 2D and 2G.},

We show experimentally that two reversible pressure-induced transitions take place in the compressed bundle SWNT. The first transition, in the 2-2.5 GPa range, is in good correspondence with predictions of the thermodynamic instability of the nanotube circular cross section for the studied tube diameter. An interaction between the fullerenes and the tube walls is then observed at about 3.5 GPa, which evidences a progressive deformation of the tube cross section. The second transition takes place at pressures between 10 and 30 GPa, and is evidenced by two effects by a strong frequency downshift of the Raman transverse modes and the concomitant disappearance of the fullerenes Raman modes in peapods. The pressure at which the second transition takes place is strongly dependent on the nature of the pressure transmitting medium. We also report irreversible effects at high pressure as the shortening of the tubes, the formation of nanostructures and the disappearance of the C-70 Raman signal in some cases.

Acid-treated CNx MWNTs exhibited a more rapid electrical breakdown with larger current steps, indicating the breakdown of several MWNT layers simultaneously.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate nitrogen- and boron-doped zigzag and armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with theoretical models based on the density functional theory. We take into account nitrogen and boron doping for two isomers in which substitutive atoms are on opposite sides of the tube, but only in one isomer the impurity sites are symmetrical with respect to the diameter. The band structures show a strong hybridization with impurity orbitals that change the original band structure. Although the two isomers of armchair SWNT exhibit the same formation energy, their band structures are different. Indeed asymmetrical isomers are gapless and exhibit a crossing of valence and conduction bands at k=pi/c, leading to metallic SWNTs. Band structures of symmetrical isomers, on the other hand, exhibit an energy gap of 0.4eV between completely filled valence and empty conduction bands. We use density of charge in order to understand this difference. In zigzag SWNT an impurity band is introduced in the energy gap and for N doping this band is just partially occupied in such a way that the electronic behaviour is reversed from semiconductor to metallic. Whereas for a given isomer armchair SWNT shows similar behaviours of N- and B-doped structures, B-doped zigzag SWNTs present different band structure and occupation compared to the N-doped case.},

The fluorination of the film by BrF3 vapor at room temperature removed the substrate; however, the vertical orientation of the nanotubes was not destroyed. Analysis of micrographs of a fluorinated sample obtained with a high-resolution transmission electron micro-scope showed that only the surface walls of the nanotubes were fluorinated. The fluorine concentration of the product as determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was about 16\%. A comparison of the N1s spectra of the starting and fluorinated samples showed that the nitrogen atoms of CNx nanotubes changed their electronic state as a result of fluorination. Matching of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic data with the results of quantum-chemical calculations for fragments of fluorinated nitrogen-doped nanotubes showed that fluorine atoms preferred to attach to pyridine-like nitrogen atoms or to carbon atoms in the ortho or meta positions relative to a nitrogen atom.},

The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute ���������������������ab initio molecular simulations��������������������� (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree���������������������Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

  abstract = {We examine the Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) line shape in the Raman spectra of carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) dispersed in aqueous suspensions. Bundling and electronic effects are studied by comparing undoped SWNTs (C-SWNTs) to boron-doped nanotubes (B-SWNTs) in a variety of different surfactant solutions. For SWNTs dispersed with nonionic surfactants that are less effective in debundling than ionic surfactants, the Raman spectra retain a large BWF feature. However, we demonstrate that even for SWNTs dispersed as isolated nanotubes by ionic surfactants the BWF feature may be present and that the intensity of the BWF is highly sensitive to the specific surfactant. In particular, surfactants with electron-donating groups tend to enhance the BWF feature. Also, modification of the SWNT electronic properties by boron doping leads to enhanced surfactant dispersion relative to undoped C-SWNTs and also to modification of the BWF feature. These observations are in agreement with reports demonstrating an enhancement of the BWF by bundling but also agree with reports that suggest electron donation can enhance the BWF feature even for isolated SWNTs. Importantly, these results serve to caution against using the lack or presence of a BWF feature as an independent measure of SWNT aggregation in surfactant dispersions.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes prepared by thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons on supported Co catalysts were investigated by STM in air. An interpretation of the STM images is proposed which accounts for specific distortions taking place while scanning three-dimensional objects whose dimensions are of the order of the curvature radius of the Lip. These distortions have both geometric and electronic origins, and cannot be neglected. The distortion mechanism was found to be different for nanotube diameters in the ranges of 1 nm and 10 nm. The 1 nm tubes are more strongly affected by their apparent broadening, reflecting the finite size of the tip apex. Here the distortion can reach up to 300\% of the geometric diameter, whereas for 10 nm tubes the distortions are in the range of 50\% of the geometric diameter. An apparent flattening of the nanotubes in the vertical direction was also found, which is attributed to differences in electronic densities of states between the substrate and the nanotube, and to an additional tunnelling barrier between the nanotube and the substrate. STM images with atomic resolution and line cut topographic profiles show similar structures as For the case of HOPG. However, the atomic corrugation was found to be five times smaller on the 1 nm diameter tubules than for the 10 nm family, the latter being close to the value obtained with HOPG. Coiled nanotubes have been imaged by STM for the first time. Here both the electrical resistance of the coiled nanotube and its elastic deformation play a significant role in the image formation process, these effects being more important than for straight nanotubes.

A small number of divacancies (5-9) brings up strong Anderson localization effects and a seemly universal curve for the resistance as a function of the number of defects.

When immobilised onto an inert boron-doped diamond substrate, TiO2 nanotubes show electrochemical reactivity due to reversible Ti(IV) reduction, which is very similar to that observed for anatase nanoparticles. Three cationic redox systems, Meldola's blue, Ni2+, and cytochrome c, are immobilised on the TiO2 nanotube surface; the binding ability and the number of binding sites are quantified voltammetrically. Redox proteins, such as cytochrome c, adsorb readily and irreversibly. Well-defined voltammetric signals for the immobilised protein are observed in an aqueous buffer.

Responses of the fabricated hybrid sensors were examined under different NO or NO2 gas concentration in the carrier gas nitrogen (N2) or air. It was observed from the experiment that the sensitivity and response time of hybrid SWCNTs-SnO2 sensors at room temperature were higher than those sensors using only CNTs or SnO2 at room temperature.

Here, we examine three particular perpendicular connections of carbon nanotubes employing two simple distinct least squares approaches and using Euler's theorem. Firstly, for (8, 0) and (4, 4) carbon nanotubes, we apply a least squares approach to the bond lengths. Sixteen distinct defects and two possible orientations for the armchair tube (4, 4) are identified. Assuming that only pentagons, hexagons, heptagons and occasionally octagons are accepted, the number of possibilities are greatly reduced. By excluding octagonal rings, the number of possible configurations may be further reduced to only one and two most likely configurations for the zigzag (8, 0) and the armchair (4, 4) tubes, respectively. Secondly, for (6, 0) and (8, 0) carbon nanotubes, we apply a least squares approach to bond angles, and for one particular (8, 0) junction, we show that the two least squares approaches produce similar structures in terms of atom locations. These purely geometric approaches can be formally related directly to certain numerical energy minimisation methods used by a number of authors.},

Using these highly reactive edge plane sites, edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes are examined with cyclic voltammetry and amperometry for the electroanalytical determination of NADH. It is demonstrated that a detection limit of 5 mu M is possible with cyclic voltammetry or 0.3 mu M using amperometry suggesting that edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes can conveniently replace carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes for biosensing applications with the relative advantages of reactivity, cost and simplicity of preparation.

  abstract = {The adsorption of NH3 and NO2 in B- or N-doped (10,0) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was investigated by using density functional computations to exploit their potential applications as gas sensors. NH3 can be chemisorbed only in B-doped SWCNTs with apparent charge transfer, so B-doped SWCNTs can be used as NH3 sensors. Both B- and N-doping make NO2 chemisorption feasible in SWCNTs, but the binding of NO2 with B is too strong, indicating an impractical recovery time as gas sensors. Due to the medium (optimal) adsorption energy and the conductance reduction accompanied with the charge transfer between SWCNTs and gas molecules, N-doped SWCNTs are potentially good NO2 sensors.

For p-type doping experimental studies on the synthesis of B doped single-walled carbon nanotubes have been reported using substitution reactions, arc discharge and laser ablation. However, synthesis using the up-scalability of the widely used chemical vapor deposition approach has not been successful so far. In this work, we present an enhanced CVD approach using high vacuum and promoting the use of solely one liquid precursor containing B and C to synthesize B-doped single walled nanotubes with unique characteristics on the subject of controlled `low doping'. In comparison to non-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes, these tubes have exceptional stability. From Raman and TEM we observe a very low defect concentration concomitant with small nanotube bundles containing 3 to 5 tubes with a narrow diameter distribution (0.9 to 1.5 nm). The defect concentration is significantly lower than in pure carbon nanotube reference samples. The overall B content and the bonding environment of the incorporated B were probed in detail for the first time by XPS. We identified different B bonding environments at less than 1 at\%. This highlights the applicability of a rigid band model improving the accessibility of these tubes with controlled p-type doping in nano- and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {An astonishing feature of carbon materials is the variety of morphological forms created by growth processes. We report here on a growth process originating from CVD diamond synthesis. The addition of nitrogen gas to the microwave plasma ignited in a CH4/H2 mixture has a profound influence on the crystal structure and morphology of diamond and graphite. Graphite appears in several forms: a single-crystal net-like planar form, nanoparticulates, and new nanotubes with perpendicularly stacked graphite rings. Nitrogen incorporation into these forms is approximately 1 at.\%. Nanotubes are also formed in the process of etching graphite by nitrogen plasma. Nanotubes and particulates are built from structural units that are graphite nanocrystals with dimensions as small as 2.5x2.5 nm2. The self-assembling tendency of these units results in different forms: rings, nanotubes or flat particles with a diameter of 70, 60 and 25 nm, respectively. Electron diffraction of material which contain 10 at.\% N indicates a lattice expansion of graphitic C-N nanocrystals compared to pure graphite. Creation of active sites for hydrogen-molecule adsorption by incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the graphitic network is the subject of speculation. Hydrogen intake for materials grown from the C-H-N gas system is 0.7-0.8 wt.\%. Measurements have been performed using a thermogravimetric method at room temperature and under hydrogen pressure of 7 MPa. TGA-150 Cahn microbalance measurements have been corrected for the buoyancy effect.},

We have performed a nanometric chemical and structural characterization by transmission electron microscopy (high-resolution mode (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy) of the synthesis products. Different boron-based compounds and other impurities were identified in the raw synthesis products. The results obtained by the TEM analysis and from the synthesis parameters (temperature, boron, and nitrogen sources) combined with phase diagram analysis to provide identification of the fundamental factors determining the nanotube growth mechanism. Our experiments strongly support a root-growth model that involves the presence of a droplet of boron. This phenomenological model considers the solubility, solidification, and segregation phenomena of the elements present in this boron droplet. In this model, we distinguish three different steps as a function of the temperature: (1) formation of the liquid boron droplet from the decomposition of different boron compounds existing in the hexagonal boron nitride target, (2) reaction of these boron droplets with nitrogen gas present in the vaporization chamber and recombination of those elements to form boron nitride, and (3) incorporation of the nitrogen atoms at the root of the boron particle at active reacting sites that achieves the growth of the tube.},

We present developments in the synthesis, the characterization, and the properties measurements and theoretical studies. These nanotubes have unique properties when compared with that of their carbon counterparts. For instance, BN-SWNTs are chemically inert, resistant to oxidation at high-temperature, and most importantly, possess a uniform electronic structure that is independent of their geometry. In the first part of this chapter, we review the different synthesis methods employed to produce these nanotubes (high and medium-low temperature processes). We then turn to the study of the atomic structure of these nanomaterials by different transmission electron microscopy techniques as well as we review the works concerning the growth mechanism of these nanotubes. Finally, the main physical (electronic, vibrational, optical, mechanical, electromechanical, and thermal) and chemical (functionalization and hydrogen storage) properties of these heteroatomic SWNTs, particularly the case of BN, are outlined, followed by the presentation of the potential applications of these nanoobjects.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the physical approaches towards enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide by controlling this semiconductor in a certain length scale from subnanometric to submillimetric distances and provides examples in which the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is not promoted by doping or changes in the chemical composition, but rather by application of physical concepts and spatial structuring of the semiconductor. Thus, encapsulation inside the micropores and cavities of zeolites ( about 1 nm) renders small titanium oxide clusters with harnessed photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, nanometric titanium particles can be ordered forming structured periodic mesoporous materials with high specific surface area and well defined porosity. Titiania nanotubes of micrometric length, either independent or forming a membrane, also exhibit unique photocatalytic activity as consequence of the long diffusion length of charge carriers along the nanotube axis. Finally, photonic crystals with an inverse opal structure and the even more powerful concept of photonic sponges can serve to slow down visible light photons inside the material, increasing the effective optical path in such a way that light absorption near the absorption onset of the material is enhanced considerably. All these physical-based approaches have shown their potential in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of titania, paving the way for a new generation of novel structured photocatalysts in which physical and chemical concepts are combined.},

In the case of nitrogen substitution (O-N), however, the tube structure remains practically the same with negligible deformation observed around the oxygen atom. The electronic band structure for O-B nanotubes is modified by the appearance of three strongly localized states, two of then as gap states. In the case Of O-N nanotubes the Fermi level is shifted into the conduction band inducing a metallic character to the doped tube. The analysis of the formation energies shows that the O-N substitution is more favorable, particularly in the case of a boron-rich environment.},

Incorporation of nitrogen affords carbon nanotube cups with a unique composition comprising multiwalled, graphitic lattice with nitrogen groups on the exterior rim and hollow interior cavities. These nanostructures demonstrate the ability to participate in hydrogen bonding because of nitrogen functionalities on their open edges. Furthermore, reaction with these nitrogen functionalities results in the coupling of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to the open rim of carbon nanotube cups. Through atomic force microscopy manipulation and adhesion force measurements, we compare the mobility of these structures on a hydrophilic surface before and after GNP coupling. Understanding of these forces will aid in useful nanostructure assembly for energy and biomedical applications.},

The effects of apical defects and doping/ adsorption on the field emission have been evaluated on the basis of magnitude of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity ( EA). Among BN nanocones examined, two 120 degrees-BN nanocones, namely 120 degrees-4-B-N and 120 degrees-55-mol-B, have been identified as promising candidates for the field-emission electron source. Effects of the applied electric field on the electronic structures of BN nanocones have been investigated. In general, the electronic structures of BN nanocones can be significantly modified by a strong electric field, such as the reduction of the HOMO-LUMO gap and the change in density of states. The interaction between BN nanocones and applied electric field can be described by the second-order Stark effect. In addition, calculations show that the doping/ adsorption of an impurity atom results in higher IP or EA values, which is unfavorable to the field emission. Our study suggests that BN nanocones can be considered as alternative cold-emission electron sources.},

Various types of GBC's were obtained by changing the reaction temperatures, and the layer sequences were clarified by x-ray diffraction. Lattice dynamics of the resultant GBC's was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Since the layer sequence of GBC's from a stage 4 FeCl3-GIC with one bi-intercalated layer is G(FeCl3)G(1)G(2)(I)G(3)G(4)(FeCl3)G, where G(n), (FeCl3), and (I) denote the nth graphite. FeCl3, and bi-intercalated layers, respectively, and all graphene layers are adjacent to an intercalate layer The GBC's give only one Raman-active E-2g((2)b) mode frequency in the Raman spectra although the intercalates are different. GBC's from stage 5 FeCl3-GIC with one bi-intercalated layer give the stacking sequence of G(FeCl3)G(1)G(2)(I)G(3)G(4)G(5)(FeCl3)G. Since two types of graphene layers, interior (G(4)) and bounding (G(1,2,3,5)) layers exist, two peaks identified as Raman-active E-2g((2)l) and E-2g((2)b) mode frequencies appear in Raman spectra. Both frequencies were affected by the bi-intercalated species. From the E-2g((2)l) frequencies, the degree of electron affinities of the bi-intercalated layers was evaluated to be in the order of IBr{\textless}ICl{\textless}SbCl5. For the GBC's with two bi-intercalated layers, their layer sequences were determined to be G(FeCl3)GG(I)G(I)GG(FeCl3)G or G(FeCl3)GG(I)GG(I)G(FeCl3)G. In this case, only bounding layers of graphite exist. However, two peaks were observed in the Raman spectra.

  abstract = {This chapter summarizes the structure, synthesis, characterization, and applications of doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene doped with heteroatoms of nitrogen (N), boron (B), and phosphorus (P). Achieving the desired functionality or modification of the properties of the carbon materials depends on the local bonding of the dopants. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which depends on the pyrolysis of precursor gases, has proven to be the most versatile and attractive technique, and it has been most commonly reported for the synthesis of doped nanotubes and graphene. The characterization of a doped nanotube sample depends closely on the aim of the study and application purpose of the material. Different and novel materials are expected to find potential applications particularly suited to their specific properties. In this respect, electrocatalysis for nitrogen doped multiwalled CNTs (N-MWCNTs) and sensing using doped single-walled species represent very promising fields. {\textbackslash}copyright 2015 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

In contrast, the B K transition of a single B dopant atom shows an unusual broad asymmetric peak which is the result of delocalized π* states away from the B dopant. The asymmetry of the B K toward higher energies is attributed to highly localized σ* antibonding states.

We discuss the possibility of identifying the isotopes of light elements and of extracting information about phonons in this signal. The energy loss is related to the mass of the much heavier nucleus, and is spread out due to atomic vibrations. Importantly, while the width of the broadening is much larger than the energy separation of isotopes, only the shift in the peak positions must be detected if the beam is limited to a single atom. We conclude that the experimental case will be challenging but is not excluded by the physical principles as far as considered here. Moreover, the initial experiments demonstrate that the separation of gold and carbon based on a signal that is related to their mass, rather than their atomic number.},

  abstract = {We review calculations and measurements of the phonon dispersion relation of graphite. First-principles calculations using density-functional theory are generally in good agreement with the experimental data since the long-range character of the dynamical matrix is properly taken into account. Calculations with a plane-wave basis demonstrate that for the in-plane optical modes, the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) yields frequencies lower by 2\% than the local-density approximation (LDA) and is thus in better agreement with experiment. The long-range character of the dynamical matrix limits the validity of force-constant approaches that take only interaction with few neighboring atoms into account. However, by fitting the force-constants to the ab initio dispersion relation, we show that the popular 4th-nearest-neighbor force-constant approach yields an excellent fit for the low frequency modes and a moderately good fit (with a maximum deviation of 6\%) for the high-frequency modes. If, in addition, the non-diagonal force-constant for the second-nearest neighbor interaction is taken into account, all the qualitative features of the high-frequency dispersion can be reproduced and the maximum deviation reduces to 4\%. We present the new parameters as a reliable basis for empirical model calculations of phonons in graphitic nanostructures, in particular carbon nanotubes.},

Since field-emission sources and aberration-corrected \{TEM\} lenses have become more widespread, sputtering has begun to impose a practical limit to the spatial resolution of microanalysis for some specimens.

It has been suggested that not accounting for this correctly is the main cause of the Stobbs factor, the ubiquitous, large contrast mismatch found between theory and experiment. In the case where a hard aperture is applied, we show that previous conclusions drawn from work using bright field scanning transmission electron microscopy and invoking the principle of reciprocity are reliable in the presence of thermal scattering. In the aperture-free case it has been suggested that even the most sophisticated mathematical models for thermal diffuse scattering lack in their numerical implementation, specifically that there may be issues in sampling, including that of the contrast transfer function of the objective lens. We show that these concerns can be satisfactorily overcome with modest computing resources; thermal scattering can be modelled accurately enough for the purpose of making quantitative comparison between simulation and experiment. Spatial incoherence of the source is also investigated. Neglect or inadequate handling of thermal scattering in simulation can have an appreciable effect on the predicted contrast and can be a significant contribution to the Stobbs factor problem.},

  abstract = {Understanding the structure of defects in crystalline materials is essential for modern materials science. While most defect characterization involves the inverse and non-unique problem of fitting possible structural models to experimental data, which are in many cases average spectra from a variety of defects (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy, Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Photoluminescense Spectroscopy (PL), etc.), being able to directly probe the atomic structure of single defects would also provide their electronic as well as mechanical properties, since those can be determined computationally, once the structure is known. This work will report on a new electron diffraction technique to directly determine the periodicity of dislocation core structures as well as a way to greatly enhance the accuracy of the forbidden reflection lattice imaging (FRLI) technique to image individual structural point defects along partial dislocations. Electron microdiffraction experiments with Silicon samples oriented along the [110] direction will be described, which will give direct experimental evidence for the double period reconstruction of the 90◦ and 30◦ partial dislocations. Also, Silicon and β-Silicon Carbide samples with atomically flat (111) surfaces have been prepared. Perfectly smooth surfaces are shown to be essential for imaging point defects such as kinks along partial dislocations in these materials. In addition to these experiments, advances in the theory of electron diffraction will be reported. A new imaging technique called ”Atomic String Holography” will be introduced, as well as a solution to the inversion problem in dynamical scattering theory based on a new expansion of the matrix exponential of two non-commuting matrices, one of which is diagonal.},

  title = {Data-{Based} {Choice} of {Histogram} {Bin} {Width}},
  volume = {51},
  abstract = {Abstract The most important parameter of a histogram is the bin width because it controls the tradeoff between presenting a picture with too much detail (“undersmoothing”) or too little detail (“oversmoothing”) with respect to the true distribution. Despite this importance there has been surprisingly little research into estimation of the “optimal” bin width. Default bin widths in most common statistical packages are, at least for large samples, quite far from the optimal bin width. Rules proposed by, for example, Scott lead to better large sample performance of the histogram, but are not consistent themselves. In this paper we extend the bin width rules of Scott to those that achieve root-n rates of convergence to the L 2-optimal bin width, thereby providing firm scientific justification for their use. Moreover, the proposed rules are simple, easy and fast to compute, and perform well in simulations.},

Despite much effort put into the graphene CVD research, there are still many challenges to be solved, not only concerning the growth itself, but also the subsequent treatment, i.e. transfer from the catalyst to a desired substrate. The need for fast progress naturally necessitates easy-to-use, versatile and efficient characterization methods. This perspective reviews the recent advances and potential of probably the most prospective one - Raman spectroscopy in connection with carbon isotope labelling of the CVD grown graphene layers. We discuss its use for the explanation and optimization of the growth process, followed by examples of employing isotope engineering in the studies of fundamental properties of graphene, not only by Raman spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Large-area graphene growth is required for the development and production of electronic devices. Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of 12C and 13C as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of 12C and 13C follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 μm/min depending upon Cu grain orientation. This data is critical in guiding the graphene growth process as we try to achieve the highest quality graphene for electronic devices.},

  abstract = {The atomic positions of the silicon carbide (SiC) polytypes 6H and 4H differ slightly from an ideal tetrahedron. These small deviations can be investigated by X-ray diffraction of so-called `quasiforbidden' reflections, which are very sensitive with respect to the extremely small variations in the structure. Nevertheless, an unambiguous calculation of the refinement parameters from the absolute values of the structure factors of the `quasiforbidden' reflections is not possible. In the case of SiC-4H, there are two and, in the case of SiC-6H, six different structure models, which yield the same absolute values of the structure factors. In order to distinguish between these models, additional phase information about the measured reflections is needed. To achieve this, Renninger-scan ({\textbackslash}psi-scan) profiles in the vicinity of three-beam cases are used. These experimentally measured {\textbackslash}psi-scans are compared with theoretical calculated profiles for each model. Another method to distinguish the different models is to compare the bond lengths between atoms of the two polytypes, which have equivalent vicinities. For both SiC-4H and SiC-6H, an unambiguous determination of the structure refinement parameters was possible.},

Results from surfaces heated at intermediate temperatures, exhibiting a mixture of these reconstructions, and after heating at a higher temperature, when graphitisation is clearly observed, are also presented. The √3 and 6√3 reconstructed surfaces exhibit characteristic core level and valence band spectra. High resolution core level spectra show unambiguously the presence of surface shifted components in both the Si 2p and C 1s core levels. For the √3 reconstruction, two surface shifted components are observed both in the Si 2p and C 1s level. For the 6√3 reconstruction, the surface region is found to contain a considerably larger amount of carbon. This carbon is found not to be graphitic since surface C 1s components with binding energies different from a graphitic C 1s peak are observed. Graphitisation, as revealed by the appearance of a graphitic C 1s peak, is observed only after heating to a higher temperature than that required for obtaining a well developed 6√3 diffraction pattern.},

  abstract = {We theoretically investigate the structural, electronic, and transport properties of bilayer silicene. Due to the large numbers of degrees of freedom permitted by the buckled structure of the silicene, its bilayer structure can present several possible stacking configurations. We show that, in the lowest energy conformation, named AAp, the bilayer silicene loses its buckled structure, becoming planar. This structural conformation is established since there is an energy gain if the system loses its π cloud to create extra (σ-like) chemical bonds between the two layers. Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show excellent agreement with experimental STM images of bilayers silicene. We also analyze the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) features of the band structure of the bilayer silicene. In particular, we show that the analysis of the 3D band structure is fundamental to a complete understanding of the electronic and transport properties in this material. Moreover, we show that different structures present distinct electronic and transport properties (IdsVds), where for some stacks we verify an anisotropic behavior of the current as a function of the direction of the applied bias.},

  abstract = {Isolation and characterization of mechanically exfoliated black phosphorus flakes with a thickness down to two single-layers is presented. A modification of the mechanical exfoliation method, which provides higher yield of atomically thin flakes than conventional mechanical exfoliation, has been developed. We present general guidelines to determine the number of layers using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a fast and reliable way. Moreover, we demonstrate that the exfoliated flakes are highly crystalline and that they are stable even in free-standing form through Raman spectroscopy and TEM measurements. A strong thickness dependence of the band structure is found by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The exciton binding energy, within an effective mass approximation, is also calculated for different number of layers. Our computational results for the optical gap are consistent with preliminary photoluminescence results on thin flakes. Finally, we study the environmental stability of black phosphorus flakes finding that the flakes are very hydrophilic and that long term exposure to air moisture etches black phosphorus away. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the aging of the flakes is slow enough to allow fabrication of field-effect transistors with strong ambipolar behavior. DFT calculations also give us insight into the water-induced changes of the structural and electronic properties of black phosphorus.},

Yet on the carbon-rich side, which we chose to explore computationally with SiC3, there was a surprise in store, a series of unusual metastable structures. The most striking of these had the appearance of a collapsed graphite structure, with benzenoid C6 units and SiSi bridges between layers. This SiC3 structure is related to known meta-(1,3,5)cyclophanes. Three other metastable structures featured layers with all carbon polyene and polyphenylene arrays.

  abstract = {Unencapsulated, exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) flakes are found to chemically degrade upon exposure to ambient conditions. Atomic force microscopy, electrostatic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to characterize the structure and chemistry of the degradation process, suggesting that O2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111) versus hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 h in ambient, followed by a ∼103 decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility after 48 h. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off ratios of ∼103 and mobilities of ∼100 cm2 V–1 s–1 for over 2 weeks in ambient conditions. This work shows that the ambient degradation of BP can be managed effectively when the flakes are sufficiently passivated. In turn, our strategy for enhancing BP environmental stability will accelerate efforts to implement BP in electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {In excitonic solar cells (XSC), power conversion efficiency (PCE) depends critically on the interface band alignment between donor and acceptor materials. Graphene or silicene is not suitable for donor materials due to their semimetallic features (zero band gaps); it is therefore highly desired to open an energy gap in graphene or silicene to extend their application in optoelectronic devices, especially in photovoltaics. In this paper, based on the global particle-swarm optimization algorithm and the density functional theory methods, we predict a novel SiC2 siligraphene (g-SiC2) with a direct band gap of 1.09 eV showing infinite planar geometry, in which Si and C atoms adopt sp2 hybridization and C atoms form delocalized 4 C-domains that are periodically separated by Si atoms. Such a g-SiC2 siligraphene (with a global minimum of energy) is 0.41 eV/atom lower and thermally stabler than the isomeric pt-SiC2 silagraphene containing planar 4-fold coordinated silicon (3000 K vs 1000 K). Interestingly, the derivative (n, 0), (n, n) nanotubes (with diameters greater than 8.0 {\textbackslash}AA) have band gaps about 1.09 eV, which are independent of the chirality and diameter. Besides, a series of g-SiC2/GaN bilayer and g-SiC2 nanotube/ZnO monolayer XSCs have been proposed, which exhibit considerably high PCEs in the range of 12–20\%.},

  abstract = {Carbon or other covalently bonded materials, like boron nitride, can form two-dimensional sheets because of the strong bonding between the atoms. In contrast, metals share electrons in a three-dimensional delocalized way, and this could preclude the formation of thin stable sheets. Nevertheless, Zhao et al. (p. 1228) observed pure iron membranes suspended across the pores in a graphene sheet. This phenomenon was discovered when an iron chloride solution, used to process the graphene, decomposed to form pure iron films across the pores. The excess of surface dangling bonds makes the formation of free-standing two-dimensional (2D) metals unstable and hence difficult to achieve. To date, only a few reports have demonstrated 2D metal formation over substrates. Here, we show a free-standing crystalline single-atom-thick layer of iron (Fe) using in situ low-voltage aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy and supporting image simulations. First-principles calculations confirm enhanced magnetic properties for single-atom-thick 2D Fe membranes. This work could pave the way for new 2D structures to be formed in graphene membranes.},

The Electron Energy Loss (EEL) spectra collected provide an experimental method of probing the bonding within a material. With the extra addition of monochromators, the energy resolution obtainable means that even more information is revealed within the fine structure of the spectra. Interpreting the fine structure can often be aided by simulation. Density-functional theory (DFT) is one method of simulating EEL spectra. DFT allows us to simulate DOS and EEL spectra from different structures. This comparison between simulation and experiment enables us to explore how changes in the spectrum are related to changes within the sample. CASTEP is a pseudopotential DFT code which can simulate both low-loss and core-loss EEL spectra. Recent developments have resulted in a separate analysis tool, OptaDOS. This package computes various spectral properties including DOS, projected DOS, joint DOS, core-loss and low-loss EEL spectra and optical spectra. One of the important aspects of the code is the way in which the DOS is calculated. This is done via linear extrapolation or adaptive smearing, methods which are not currently available within CASTEP (or indeed any other code) and which allow detailed analysis of spectral properties. This paper summarises these developments and what they mean for the interpretation of EEL spectra.},

We also show that the largest fraction of nitrogen amount is found in poly aromatic species that are adsorbed on the surface of the nanotube walls.

We are able to explain the fundamental FT-ICR phenomena from a simplified theoretical treatment of ion behavior in idealized magnetic and electric fields. The effects of trapping voltage, trap size and shape, and other nonidealities are manifested mainly as perturbations that preserve the idealized ion behavior modified by appropriate numerical correction factors. Topics include: effect of ion mass, charge, magnetic field, and trapping voltage on ion cyclotron frequency; excitation and detection of ICR signals; mass calibration; mass resolving power and mass accuracy; upper mass limit(s); dynamic range; detection limit, strategies for mass and energy selection for MSn; ion axialization, cooling, and remeasurement; and means for guiding externally formed ions into the ion trap. The relation of FT-ICR MS to other types of Fourier transform spectroscopy and to the Paul (quadrupole) ion trap is described. The article concludes with selected applications, an appendix listing accurate fundamental constants needed for ultrahigh-precision analysis, and an annotated list of selected reviews and primary source publications that describe in further detail various FT-ICR MS techniques and applications. {\textbackslash}copyright 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 17, 1–35, 1998},

We have subsequently applied the technique to iage the depth distribution of a sub-surface nitrogen δ-layer with nanometer spatial resolution.

The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved in the scattering of kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon peaks, inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the electronic densities of states. Examples are given of the use of EELS for the measurement of local properties, including specimen thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap) and chemical composition. Factors that determine the spatial resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation damage to the specimen.

This combination makes TOF-SIMS highly suitable for the analysis especially of small samples, like interplanetary and presolar dust grains, as well as tiny inclusions within meteorites.

The deviation appears to be small and may be outweighed by the effect of plural (elastic + inelastic) scattering, which is not removed by conventional deconvolution methods. In the core-loss region of the spectrum, non-Lorentzian behaviour stems from a reduction of the generalized oscillator strength from its optical value and (for energies far above an ionization threshold) formation of a Bethe-ridge angular distribution. At incident energies above 200 keV, retardation effects further distort the angular dependence, even for core losses just above threshold. With an on-axis collection aperture, non-dipole effects are masked by the rapid falloff of intensity with scattering angle, but they may become important for off-axis measurements. Near-edge fine structure is sensitive to nondipole effects but these can be minimized by use of an angle-limiting collection aperture. Microsc. Res.

  abstract = {Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) is a specialized technique used to provide information about the geographic, chemical, and biological origins of substances. The ability to determine the source of an organic substance stems from the relative isotopic abundances of the elements which comprise the material. Because the isotope ratios of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen can become locally enriched or depleted through a variety of kinetic and thermodynamic factors, measurement of the isotope ratios can be used to differentiate between samples which otherwise share identical chemical compositions. Several sample introduction methods are now available for commercial isotope ratio mass spectrometers. Combustion is most commonly used for bulk isotopic analysis, whereas gas and liquid chromatography are predominately used for the real-time isotopic analysis of specific compounds within a mixture. Here, highlights of advances in instrumentation and applications within the last three years are provided to illustrate the impact of this rapidly growing area of research. Some prominent new applications include authenticating organic food produce, ascertaining whether or not African elephants are guilty of night-time raids on farmers' crops, and linking forensic drug and soil samples from a crime scene to a suspected point of origin.

In this work we employ an optimized experimental setup to reduce electron illumination below damage limit. GO oxygen maps obtained at a few nanometers scale show separated domains with different oxidation levels. The C/O ratio varies from about 4:1 to 1:1, the latter corresponding to a complete functionalization of the graphene flakes. In RGO the residual oxygen concentrates mostly in regions few tens of nanometers wide. Specific energy-loss near-edge structures are observed for different oxidation levels. By combining these findings with first-principles simulations we propose a model for the highly oxidized domains where graphene is fully functionalized by hydroxyl groups forming a 2D-sp3 carbon network analogous to that of graphane.},

  title = {Ion implantation of low energy {Si} into graphene: insight from computational studies},
  volume = {5},
  abstract = {By employing both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), we studied the efficiency of doping graphene with low energy Si ions implantation. Mainly two types of substitutional doping configurations resulting from Si ion implantation were found in graphene, namely perfect Si substitution at monovacancy (Si@MV), and Si interstitial defect at divacancy site (Si@DV). High efficiency for Si substitutions was obtained within a wide energy range varied between 30-150 eV. At the optimum energy of 70 eV, up to 59\% of the incident Si ions would be incorporated in graphene by Si@MV. Moreover, the experimental doping efficiency should be higher than the above value of 59\% because Si adatom on graphene surface can be eventually turned into a substitution atom via annihilating with a vacancy defect produced in the collision process. Such high doping efficiency makes ion implantation a powerful tool to dope graphene with Si and similar elements. Our results provide a theoretical clue for the property engineering of graphene by using ion irradiation technique, in particular for doping graphene with heavy ions.},

  abstract = {We investigate the structural, electronic, and transport properties of substitutional defects in SiC-graphene by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and magnetotransport experiments. Using ion incorporation via ultralow energy ion implantation, the influence of different ion species (boron, nitrogen, and carbon) can directly be compared. While boron and nitrogen atoms lead to an effective doping of the graphene sheet and can reduce or raise the position of the Fermi level, respectively, 12C+ carbon ions are used to study possible defect creation by the bombardment. For low-temperature transport, the implantation leads to an increase in resistance and a decrease in mobility in contrast to undoped samples. For undoped samples, we observe in high magnetic fields a positive magnetoresistance that changes to negative for the doped samples, especially for 11B+- and 12C+-ions. We conclude that the conductivity of the graphene sheet is lowered by impurity atoms and especially by lattice defects, because they result in weak localization effects at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Functionalisation of two-dimensional (2-D) materials via low energy ion implantation could open possibilities for fabrication of devices based on such materials. Nanoscale patterning and/or electronically doping can thus be achieved, compatible with large scale integrated semiconductor technologies. Using atomic resolution High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy supported by image simulation, we show that sites and chemical nature of individual implants/ dopants in graphene, as well as impurities in hBN, can uniquely and directly be identified on grounds of their position and their image intensity in accordance with predictions from Z-contrast theories. Dopants in graphene (e.g., N) are predominantly substitutional. In other 2-Ds, e.g. dichalcogenides, the situation is more complicated since implants can be embedded in different layers and substitute for different elements. Possible configurations of Se-implants in MoS2 are discussed and image contrast calculations performed. Implants substituting for S in the top or bottom layer can undoubtedly be identified. We show, for the first time, using \{HAADF\} contrast measurement that successful Se-integration into MoS2 can be achieved via ion implantation, and we demonstrate the possibility of \{HAADF\} image contrast measurements for identifying impurities and dopants introduced into in 2-Ds.},

  abstract = {High-performance silicon transistors can have gate channel lengths as short as 5 nm before source-drain tunneling and loss of electrostatic control lead to unacceptable leakage current when the device is off. Desai et al. explored the use of MoS2 as a gate material, given that its electronic properties as thin layers should limit such leakage. A transistor with a 1-nm physical gate was constructed with a MoS2 bilayer gate and a single-walled carbon nanotube gate electrode. Excellent switching characteristics and an on-off state current ratio of ∼106 were observed.Science, this issue p. 99Scaling of silicon (Si) transistors is predicted to fail below 5-nanometer (nm) gate lengths because of severe short channel effects. As an alternative to Si, certain layered semiconductors are attractive for their atomically uniform thickness down to a monolayer, lower dielectric constants, larger band gaps, and heavier carrier effective mass. Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transistors with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled carbon nanotube as the gate electrode. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of 65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of 106. Simulations show an effective channel length of 3.9 nm in the Off state and 1 nm in the On state.},

  doi = {10.1088/2053-1583/aa5e78},
  abstract = {One of the keys behind the success of modern semiconductor technology has been the ion implantation of silicon, which allows its electronic properties to be tailored. For similar purposes, heteroatoms have been introduced into carbon nanomaterials both during growth and using post-growth methods. However, due to the nature of the samples, it has been challenging to determine whether the heteroatoms have been incorporated into the lattice as intended. Direct observations have so far been limited to N and B dopants, and incidental Si impurities. Furthermore, ion implantation of these materials is challenging due to the requirement of very low ion energies and atomically clean surfaces. Here, we provide the first atomic-resolution imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) evidence of phosphorus atoms in the graphene lattice, implanted by low-energy ion irradiation. The measured P L 2,3 -edge shows excellent agreement with an ab initio spectrum simulation, conclusively identifying the P in a buckled substitutional configuration. While advancing the use of EELS for single-atom spectroscopy, our results demonstrate the viability of phosphorus as a lattice dopant in sp 2 -bonded carbon structures and provide its unmistakable fingerprint for further studies.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox.Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.},

To create the GNCs, freely suspended graphene ribbons were fabricated using few-layer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition. The ribbons were loaded into the TEM, and a current-annealing procedure was used to clean the material and improve its electronic characteristics. The TEM beam was then used to sculpt GNCs to a series of desired widths in the range 1–700 nm; after each sculpting step, the sample was imaged by TEM and its electronic properties were measured in situ. GNC conductance was found to be remarkably high, comparable to that of exfoliated graphene samples of similar size. The GNC conductance varied with width approximately as G(w) = (e2/h)w0.75, where w is the constriction width in nanometers. GNCs support current densities greater than 120 μA/nm2, 2 orders of magnitude higher than that which has been previously reported for graphene nanoribbons and 2000 times higher than that reported for copper.},

Upon breaking off, the 3D SiC was confirmed to be made from 2D nanosheets. The resulting novel 2D SiC nanosheets/nanoflakes were thoroughly investigated by using optical microscope, SEM, EDS, TEM, STEM, AFM, and Raman, which verified the highly crystallised structure feature. AFM results revealed an average thickness of 2–3 nm and average size of 2 μ m for the flakes.

However, for many practical studies and applications the ordered hexagon arrangement of carbon atoms in graphene is not directly suitable. Here, we show that the atoms can be locally either removed or rearranged into a random pattern of polygons using a focused ion beam (FIB). The atomic structure of the disordered regions is confirmed with atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy images. These structural modifications can be made on macroscopic scales with a spatial resolution determined only by the size of the ion beam. With just one processing step, three types of structures can be defined within a graphene layer: chemically inert graphene, chemically active amorphous 2D carbon, and empty areas. This, along with the changes in properties, gives promise that FIB patterning of graphene will open the way for creating all-carbon heterostructures to be used in fields ranging from nanoelectronics and chemical sensing to composite materials.},

The nitrogen inclusion was observed by scanning X-ray photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) with energy resolution of 0.2 eV and spatial resolution of 10 nm. \{SPEM\} can be used to follow the evolution of nitrogen species: pyridinic, graphitic, and pyrrolic, at different doping stages and annealing temperatures. Variations in the ratio between sp2 nitrogen species was observed for increasing treatment time; annealing results in quenching of the sp3 component, suggesting the graphitic nitrogen as the most thermal stable species. The occurrence of graphitic species together with the absence of pyrrolic is indicative of N-incorporation into a hexagonal graphene-based lattice. Ion irradiation followed by annealing performed in a controlled way is a promising strategy to fine control the nature of the nitrogen species grafted to the graphene while focusing on selected applications.},

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a macromolecule commonly used for graphene transfer and device processing, leaving a thin layer of residue to be empirically cleaned by annealing. Here we report on a systematic study of PMMA decomposition on graphene and of its impact on graphene's intrinsic properties using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with Raman spectroscopy. TEM images revealed that the physisorbed PMMA proceeds in two steps of weight loss in annealing and cannot be removed entirely at a graphene susceptible temperature before breaking. Raman analysis shows a remarkable blue-shift of the 2D mode after annealing, implying an anneal-induced band structure modulation in graphene with defects. Calculations using density functional theory show that local rehybridization of carbons from sp2 to sp3 on graphene defects may occur in the random scission of polymer chains and account for the blue-shift of the Raman 2D mode.},

The lateral length of the as-synthesized quasi-2D SiC is mainly in the range of 0.3–5 μm while the thickness is commonly below 10 nm. Quasi-2D SiC2 is also found as a byproduct, which is stable over 3 months in air atmosphere. The exciton binding energy of quasi-2D multilayers SiC can reach 0.23 eV while the band gap is around 3.72 eV. Additionally, in situ transmission electron microscopy has firmly proven that quasi-2D SiC can be synthesized through the reaction between graphene and silicon quantum dots.

These spectra are deconvoluted into two different contributions, at 284.4 eV and 285.2 eV, which are respectively attributed to sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. From the deconvoluted spectra, the sp3 content in the films is evaluated. It is found to increase from 33\% to about 60\% as laser intensity is varied from 0.9×108 to 7.1×108 W/cm2. These measurements have been compared to those obtained by the analysis of the C \{KLL\} X-ray excited Auger electron spectra. The two methods provide the same qualitative variation of the sp3 content with laser intensity. However, the \{XPS\} of the C 1s core level yields systematically higher sp3 content values. These differences are attributed to the presence of an sp2 rich outer layer on the surface of the \{DLC\} films, as confirmed by angle-resolved XPS. The analysis of the C 1s peak is shown to be a very simple and direct method to evaluate the sp3 content in unhydrogenated \{DLC\} thin films.},

Using systematic optical studies, we demonstrate that van der Waals interaction is the dominant factor for the chemical reactivity of graphene on two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures. A significant enhancement in the chemical stability of graphene is achieved by replacing the common SiO2 substrate with 2D crystals such as an additional graphene layer, WS2, MoS2, or h-BN. Our theoretical and experimental results show that its origin is a strong van der Waals interaction between the graphene layer and the 2D substrate. This results in a high resistive force on graphene toward geometric lattice deformation. We also demonstrate that the chemical reactivity of graphene can be controlled by the relative lattice orientation with respect to the substrates and thus can be used for a wide range of applications including hydrogen storage.},

An interesting example is the two-dimensional form of silicon carbide (2D-SiC). Here, we present an observation of atomically thin and hexagonally bonded nanosized grains of SiC assembling temporarily in graphene oxide pores during an atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment. Even though these small grains do not fully represent the bulk crystal, simulations indicate that their electronic structure already approaches that of 2D-SiC. This is predicted to be flat, but some doubts have remained regarding the preference of Si for sp 3 hybridization. Exploring a number of corrugated morphologies, we find completely flat 2D-SiC to have the lowest energy. We further compute its phonon dispersion, with a Raman-active transverse optical mode, and estimate the core level binding energies. Finally, we study the chemical reactivity of 2D-SiC, suggesting it is like silicene unstable against molecular absorption or interlayer linking. Nonetheless, it can form stable van der Waals-bonded bilayers with either graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, promising to further enrich the family of two-dimensional materials once bulk synthesis is achieved.},

  doi = {10.1088/0953-8984/26/18/183001},
  abstract = {The development of interatomic potentials employing artificial neural networks has seen tremendous progress in recent years. While until recently the applicability of neural network potentials (NNPs) has been restricted to low-dimensional systems, this limitation has now been overcome and high-dimensional NNPs can be used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of thousands of atoms. NNPs are constructed by adjusting a set of parameters using data from electronic structure calculations, and in many cases energies and forces can be obtained with very high accuracy. Therefore, NNP-based simulation results are often very close to those gained by a direct application of first-principles methods. In this review, the basic methodology of high-dimensional NNPs will be presented with a special focus on the scope and the remaining limitations of this approach. The development of NNPs requires substantial computational effort as typically thousands of reference calculations are required. Still, if the problem to be studied involves very large systems or long simulation times this overhead is regained quickly. Further, the method is still limited to systems containing about three or four chemical elements due to the rapidly increasing complexity of the configuration space, although many atoms of each species can be present. Due to the ability of NNPs to describe even extremely complex atomic configurations with excellent accuracy irrespective of the nature of the atomic interactions, they represent a general and therefore widely applicable technique, e.g. for addressing problems in materials science, for investigating properties of interfaces, and for studying solvation processes.},

The G-mode phonons exhibit reduced energies (1580 cm−1) and increased widths (14 cm−1) compared to the response of graphene monolayers supported on the SiO2-covered substrate. From analysis of the G-mode Raman spectra, we deduce that the free-standing graphene monolayers are essentially undoped, with an upper bound of 2 × 1011 cm−2 for the residual carrier concentration. On the supported regions, significantly higher and spatially inhomogeneous doping is observed. The free-standing graphene monolayers show little local disorder, based on the very weak Raman D-mode response. The two-phonon 2D mode of the free-standing graphene monolayers is downshifted in frequency compared to that of the supported region of the samples and exhibits a narrowed, positively skewed line shape.},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite decades of research, the ultimate goal of nanotechnology—top-down manipulation of individual atoms—has been directly achieved with only one technique: scanning probe microscopy. In this Review, we demonstrate that scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is emerging as an alternative method for the direct assembly of nanostructures, with possible applications in plasmonics, quantum technologies, and materials science. Atomically precise manipulation with STEM relies on recent advances in instrumentation that have enabled non-destructive atomic-resolution imaging at lower electron energies. While momentum transfer from highly energetic electrons often leads to atom ejection, interesting dynamics can be induced when the transferable kinetic energies are comparable to bond strengths in the material. Operating in this regime, very recent experiments have revealed the potential for single-atom manipulation using the {\textbackslash}AAngström-sized electron beam. To truly enable control, however, it is vital to understand the relevant atomic-scale phenomena through accurate dynamical simulations. Although excellent agreement between experiment and theory for the specific case of atomic displacements from graphene has been recently achieved using density functional theory molecular dynamics, in many other cases quantitative accuracy remains a challenge. We provide a comprehensive reanalysis of available experimental data on beam-driven dynamics in light of the state-of-the-art in simulations, and identify important targets for improvement. In short, the modern electron microscope has great potential to become an atom-scale fabrication platform, especially for covalently bonded 2D nanostructures. We review the developments that have made this possible, argue that graphene is an ideal starting material, and assess the main challenges moving forward.},

Unlike analogous electron beam induced deposition models, it is shown that one must consider the diffusion, desorption, and possible re-dissociation of the resultant etch product to understand the observed etching profiles. To confirm the explanation of the etch results, a defocus experiment was performed showing transitions from the electron flux limited to the mass transport limited to the etch product dissociation limited regimes.},

  abstract = {The characterization of nanostructures down to the atomic scale is essential to understand some physical properties. Such a characterization is possible today using direct imaging methods such as aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), when iteratively backed by advanced modeling produced by theoretical structure calculations and image calculations. Aberration-corrected HRTEM is therefore extremely useful for investigating low-dimensional structures, such as inorganic fullerene-like particles and inorganic nanotubes. The atomic arrangement in these nanostructures can lead to new insights into the growth mechanism or physical properties, where imminent commercial applications are unfolding. This article will focus on two structures that are symmetric and reproducible. The first structure that will be dealt with is the smallest stable symmetric closed-cage structure in the inorganic system, a MoS2 nanooctahedron. It is investigated by means of aberration-corrected microscopy which allowed validating the suggested DFTB-MD model. It will be shown that structures diverging from the energetically most stable structures are present in the laser ablated soot and that the alignment of the different shells is parallel, unlike the bulk material where the alignment is antiparallel. These findings correspond well with the high-energy synthetic route and they provide more insight into the growth mechanism. The second structure studied is WS2 nanotubes, which have already been shown to have a unique structure with very desirable mechanical properties. The joint HRTEM study combined with modeling reveals new information regarding the chirality of the different shells and provides a better understanding of their growth mechanism.},

We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system.

They were analyzed with SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of (N-doped) graphene was confirmed by the 2D mode of the Raman spectra. The isolated graphene films obtained from nitrogen-containing precursors reveal a high conductivity and transparency compared to standard graphene CVD samples. Precursors with amine functional groups (e.g., methylamine) can lead to a direct formation of graphene even without additional hydrogen present in the gas phase. This is not observed for, e.g., methane under comparable CVD conditions. Therefore, the intermediate gas phase species (e.g., amine radicals) can significantly enhance the graphene film growth kinetics.

Perhaps the most recognized issues are background signal and noise contributed by sample supports, sample charging and instability. Graphene provides supports of single atom thickness, extreme physical stability, periodic structure, and ballistic electrical conductivity. As an increasing number of applications adapting graphene to their benefit emerge, we discuss the unique capabilities afforded by the use of graphene as a sample support for electron microscopy.},

This modification is in both cases shown to be relatively localized, with data suggesting the plasmonic response tailoring can no longer be detected within experimental uncertainties beyond a distance of approximately 1 nm from the dopant. Ab initio calculations confirm the trends observed experimentally. Our results directly confirm the possibility of tailoring the plasmonic properties of graphene in the ultraviolet waveband at the atomic scale, a crucial step in the quest for utilizing graphene's properties toward the development of plasmonic and optoelectronic devices operating at ultraviolet frequencies.},

We characterize this overlapping h-BN grain boundary structure in detail by complementary (scanning) transmission electron microscopy techniques and propose a catalytic growth mechanism linked to the subsurface/bulk of the process catalyst and its boron and nitrogen solubilities. Our data suggest that the overlapping grain boundaries are comparatively resilient against deleterious pinhole formation associated with grain boundary defect lines and thus may reduce detrimental breakdown effects when polycrystalline h-BN monolayer films are used as ultrathin dielectrics, barrier layers, or separation membranes.},

  abstract = {Graphene sheets–one-atom-thick two-dimensional layers of sp2-bonded carbon–are predicted to have a range of unusual properties. Their thermal conductivity and mechanical stiffness may rival the remarkable in-plane values for graphite (approximately 3,000 W m(-1) K(-1) and 1,060 GPa, respectively); their fracture strength should be comparable to that of carbon nanotubes for similar types of defects; and recent studies have shown that individual graphene sheets have extraordinary electronic transport properties. One possible route to harnessing these properties for applications would be to incorporate graphene sheets in a composite material. The manufacturing of such composites requires not only that graphene sheets be produced on a sufficient scale but that they also be incorporated, and homogeneously distributed, into various matrices. Graphite, inexpensive and available in large quantity, unfortunately does not readily exfoliate to yield individual graphene sheets. Here we present a general approach for the preparation of graphene-polymer composites via complete exfoliation of graphite and molecular-level dispersion of individual, chemically modified graphene sheets within polymer hosts. A polystyrene-graphene composite formed by this route exhibits a percolation threshold of approximately 0.1 volume per cent for room-temperature electrical conductivity, the lowest reported value for any carbon-based composite except for those involving carbon nanotubes; at only 1 volume per cent, this composite has a conductivity of approximately 0.1 S m(-1), sufficient for many electrical applications. Our bottom-up chemical approach of tuning the graphene sheet properties provides a path to a broad new class of graphene-based materials and their use in a variety of applications.},

  abstract = {The effect of electron irradiation on the dynamic behavior of Fe atoms, embedded into monovacancy (Fe@MV) and divacancy (Fe@DV) defects in graphene, has been investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics. This study reveals the detailed mechanisms of transformation and migration of Fe@MV and Fe@DV defects in graphene recently observed in aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM) experiments [Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 1468]. An important atomic-scale insight into the dynamics of atomic Fe on graphene, unavailable to AC-HRTEM observations, has been provided. It was found that structural changes of the studied defects are induced by electron impacts on carbon atoms bonded to Fe. The threshold energies for ejection of these carbon atoms are significantly lower compared to that in pristine graphene. For electron impacts with the subthreshold transferred energies, migration of the defects and flipping of Fe atoms between different sides of the graphene plane can occur. The stability of a Fe@MV defect under electron irradiation strongly depends on the substrate side position of the Fe atom with respect to the direction of the electron beam. The Fe@DV → Fe@MV transformations take place spontaneously in the presence of carbon adatoms, which are available in abundance on graphene in AC-HRTEM. The present study facilitates a greater general understanding of the dynamic behavior of substitutional metal atoms in graphene.},

Single bismuth dopant atoms in silicon provide an ideal case study in view of proposals for single-dopant quantum bits. However, bismuth is the least soluble pnictogen in silicon, meaning that the dopant atoms tend to migrate out of position during sample growth. Here we demonstrate epitaxial growth of thin silicon films doped with bismuth. We use atomic-resolution aberration-corrected imaging to view the as-grown dopant distribution and then to controllably position single dopants inside the film. Atomic-scale quantum-mechanical calculations corroborate the experimental findings. These results indicate that the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is of particular interest for assembling functional materials atom-by-atom because it offers both real-time monitoring and atom manipulation. We envision electron-beam manipulation of atoms inside materials as an achievable route to controllable assembly of structures of individual dopants.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in scanning transmission electron and scanning probe microscopies have opened exciting opportunities in probing the materials structural parameters and various functional properties in real space with angstrom-level precision. This progress has been accompanied by an exponential increase in the size and quality of data sets produced by microscopic and spectroscopic experimental techniques. These developments necessitate adequate methods for extracting relevant physical and chemical information from the large data sets, for which a priori information on the structures of various atomic configurations and lattice defects is limited or absent. Here we demonstrate an application of deep neural networks to extract information from atomically resolved images including location of the atomic species and type of defects. We develop a “weakly supervised” approach that uses information on the coordinates of all atomic species in the image, extracted via a deep neural network, to identify a rich variety of defects that are not part of an initial training set. We further apply our approach to interpret complex atomic and defect transformation, including switching between different coordination of silicon dopants in graphene as a function of time, formation of peculiar silicon dimer with mixed 3-fold and 4-fold coordination, and the motion of molecular “rotor”. This deep learning-based approach resembles logic of a human operator, but can be scaled leading to significant shift in the way of extracting and analyzing information from raw experimental data.},

  abstract = {The electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of bilayer and trilayer graphene vary with their structure, including the stacking order and relative twist, providing novel ways to realize useful characteristics not available to single layer graphene. However, developing controlled growth of bilayer and trilayer graphene requires efficient large-scale characterization of multilayer graphene structures. Here, we use dark-field transmission electron microscopy for rapid and accurate determination of key structural parameters (twist angle, stacking order, and interlayer spacing) of few-layer CVD graphene. We image the long-range atomic registry for oriented bilayer and trilayer graphene, find that it conforms exclusively to either Bernal or rhombohedral stacking, and determine their relative abundances. In contrast, our data on twisted multilayers suggest the absence of such long-range atomic registry. The atomic registry and its absence are consistent with the two different strain-induced deformations we observe; by tilting the samples to break mirror symmetry, we find a high density of twinned domains in oriented multilayer graphene, where multiple domains of two different stacking configurations coexist, connected by discrete twin boundaries. In contrast, individual layers in twisted regions continuously stretch and shear independently, forming elaborate Moiré patterns. These results, and the twist angle distribution in our CVD graphene, can be understood in terms of an angle-dependent interlayer potential model.},

  abstract = {Atomic-resolution structural and spectroscopic characterization techniques (scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy) are combined with nanoscale electrical measurements (conductive atomic force microscopy) to study at the atomic scale the properties of graphene grown epitaxially through the controlled graphitization of a hexagonal SiC(0001) substrate by high temperature annealing. This growth technique is known to result in a pronounced electron-doping (∼1013 cm–2) of graphene, which is thought to originate from an interface carbon buffer layer strongly bound to the substrate. The scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis, carried out at an energy below the knock-on threshold for carbon to ensure no damage is imparted to the film by the electron beam, demonstrates that the buffer layer present on the planar SiC(0001) face delaminates from it on the (112̅n) facets of SiC surface steps. In addition, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals that the delaminated layer has a similar electronic configuration to purely sp2-hybridized graphene. These observations are used to explain the local increase of the graphene sheet resistance measured around the surface steps by conductive atomic force microscopy, which we suggest is due to significantly lower substrate-induced doping and a resonant scattering mechanism at the step regions. A first-principles-calibrated theoretical model is proposed to explain the structural instability of the buffer layer on the SiC facets and the resulting delamination.},

  abstract = {The burgeoning field of atomic-level material control holds great promise for future breakthroughs in quantum and memristive device manufacture and fundamental studies of atomic-scale chemistry. Realization of atom-by-atom control of matter represents a complex and ongoing challenge. Here, we explore the feasibility of controllable motion of dopant Si atoms at the edges of graphene via the sub-atomically focused electron beam in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We demonstrate that the graphene edges can be cleaned of Si atoms and then subsequently replenished from nearby source material. It is also shown how Si edge atoms may be “pushed” from the edge of a small hole into the bulk of the graphene lattice and from the bulk of the lattice back to the edge. This is accomplished through sputtering of the edge of the graphene lattice to bury or uncover Si dopant atoms. Finally, we demonstrate e-beam mediated hole healing and incorporation of dopant atoms. These experiments form an initial step toward general atomic-scale material control.},

  abstract = {Abstract Building materials from the atom up is the pinnacle of materials fabrication. Until recently the only platform that offered single-atom manipulation was scanning tunneling microscopy. Here controlled manipulation and assembly of a few atom structures are demonstrated by bringing together single atoms using a scanning transmission electron microscope. An atomically focused electron beam is used to introduce Si substitutional defects and defect clusters in graphene with spatial control of a few nanometers and enable controlled motion of Si atoms. The Si substitutional defects are then further manipulated to form dimers, trimers, and more complex structures. The dynamics of a beam-induced atomic-scale chemical process is captured in a time-series of images at atomic resolution. These studies suggest that control of the e-beam-induced local processes offers the next step toward atom-by-atom nanofabrication, providing an enabling tool for the study of atomic-scale chemistry in 2D materials and fabrication of predefined structures and defects with atomic specificity.},

Recent advances in imaging resolution and sample stability have made scanning transmission electron microscopy a promising alternative for single-atom manipulation of covalently bound materials. Pioneering experiments using an atomically focused electron beam have demonstrated the directed movement of silicon atoms over a handful of sites within the graphene lattice. Here, we achieve a much greater degree of control, allowing us to precisely move silicon impurities along an extended path, circulating a single hexagon, or back and forth between the two graphene sublattices. Even with manual operation, our manipulation rate is already comparable to the state-of-the-art in any atomically precise technique. We further explore the influence of electron energy on the manipulation rate, supported by improved theoretical modeling taking into account the vibrations of atoms near the impurities, and implement feedback to detect manipulation events in real time. In addition to atomic-level engineering of its structure and properties, graphene also provides an excellent platform for refining the accuracy of quantitative models and for the development of automated manipulation.},
