  title: A Practical Guide to Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy Simulations
  # short_title: Guide to STEM/TEM Simulations
  # description: The goal of the text is to enable readers to have an understanding of both the theory and practical applications of S/TEM image simulation. After reading, you should feel comfortable in devising, preparing and running S/TEM image simulations, and be able to critically assess simulated images in literature.
